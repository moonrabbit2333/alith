This is more than a technical milestone; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the start of a community-driven movement designed to empower developers, early users, and innovators from across the Web3 space.While spending nearly $500,000 on the campaign, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to just hold another hackathon or just another Twitter campaign. We wanted to really drive value towards the ecosystem and users. We wanted to create a time where we all get involved in the growth of Hyperion from testnet to mainnet, and create a community where the community itself is a flywheel of value.Our campaign will unfold in three key phases of exciting community campaigns, a new platform to house our community, and tons of community and developer campaigns, each designed to build momentum, drive adoption, and reward participation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all leading up to the highly anticipated Mainnet launch.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also have a series of articles to dig deep into all the campaigns, ways to get involved, and our strategy for the Hyperion Launch Campaign, so stay tuned!For a quick list of activities on the Hyperion Launch Campaign, follow the link here.Phase 1: Testnet, Forum, Hackathon LaunchThe campaign kicks off with the Testnet launch, giving developers and ecosystem partners early access to the tools and infrastructure that will power the network. To accelerate innovation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hosting a global Hackathon, inviting builders to experiment, deploy dApps, and stress-test the chain.All of this will be centred around the new Forum we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built, a place where Metisians can come together to drive innovation, community building, and just a fun place to be in general. It is the start of our \u00e2\u0080\u009cbottom-up governance by action through discussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009dParticipants will compete for recognition, prizes, and new types of perks, helping shape the first wave of applications on our chain.Phase 2: Incentivized Campaigns for Users & DevelopersOver the following months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll roll out a series of incentivized campaigns aimed at both users and developers. The middle months are where we all build momentum, both for the Metis community and Hyperion to work towards building something great. Phase 2 has a host of value-added and fun activities:On-chain missions to engage and reward early adoptersBuilder incentives for deploying and refining dAppsCommunity quests that promote testing, feedback, helping answer questions on the Forum, and advocacyWorkshops, free resources, and other value-added activities to elevate the innovations coming from Hyperion and blockchain in generalThe general vibe of the middle months is excitement, optimism for building and helping, driving value towards the builder community, and some fun shenanigans sprinkled throughout.Phase 3: Mainnet LaunchThe campaign culminates in the official Mainnet launch, bringing the full power of the network online. Backed by real-world testing, community-driven feedback, and battle-tested apps, our launch will mark the beginning of a new era of scalable, efficient, and inclusive blockchain infrastructure.Expect exciting new uses of an instant L2, new and exciting applications of AI on blockchain, major partnership announcements, and cross-chain integrations, and you, the community, as the centrepiece.This is just the beginning. Join us as we build the next evolution of decentralized infrastructure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 together.Stay tuned, stay involved, and get ready to launch.

Developers often need a reliable way to serve data to their frontends without relying solely on RPC calls, which can be slow, limited, or difficult to scale.In this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Metis developer workshop, we were joined by Marcus Rein, Developer Relations at The Graph, for an in-depth session on building subgraphs. The focus was on understanding how subgraphs provide structured, queryable, and performant access to blockchain data\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially useful for applications building on the Metis Layer 2 ecosystem.This post recaps the key takeaways from the workshop, along with supporting resources and code.Workshop Recording: Watch the full session on YouTubeCode Repository: Subgraph Dev Workshop GitHubUnderstanding the Role of SubgraphsA subgraph is a powerful tool that enables developers to index and query blockchain data using GraphQL. It provides a structured, API-like interface over blockchain data, and allows applications to retrieve specific datasets efficiently and reliably.While direct smart contract queries through libraries like ethers.js can be effective in small use cases, they quickly become limited when dealing with large volumes of data, cross-contract relationships, or complex filtering logic.Subgraphs offer the following advantages:High-performance GraphQL querying capabilitiesReal-time access to indexed blockchain eventsCustomizable schema and transformations for application-specific needsSeamless integration with modern frontend frameworksOptional deployment to a decentralized network for fault-tolerant indexingWhy Subgraphs Matter for Metis DevelopersIn the context of Metis, subgraphs unlock significant value for teams building DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAO dashboards, or analytics-driven applications.Use cases include:Building user portfolio dashboards with onchain lending, borrowing, or staking dataTracking governance events or smart contract proposal voting historiesIndexing NFT ownership and transfers for collectibles and gaming assetsPowering Telegram or Discord bots with real-time blockchain updatesBy leveraging subgraphs, developers reduce reliance on centralized infrastructure and gain more control over how data is accessed and served.Workshop Overview: What We BuiltDuring the workshop, the following steps were demonstrated:Setting up The Graph CLI and environmentInitializing a subgraph project using a smart contract addressIndexing smart contract events and transforming them into database entitiesRunning the subgraph in a local development environmentWriting GraphQL queries to retrieve structured dataUnderstanding how subgraphs can be extended and published to The Graph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decentralized indexing networkAlthough the demonstration was conducted using Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CryptoPunks contract, the process is fully applicable to any EVM-compatible chain, including Metis.Technical OverviewThe workshop introduced three key components of a subgraph:1.\u00c2\u00a0subgraph.yamlThis is the manifest file that defines the smart contracts, start block, and data sources to be indexed. It also specifies the relationship between contract events and their corresponding event handlers (mappings).2.\u00c2\u00a0schema.graphqlDefines the shape of the data stored in the subgraph. This includes entities, field types, and relationships. It serves as the schema for GraphQL queries.3. Mapping Handlers (*.ts)These TypeScript files contain the logic for transforming event data into entities that match the defined schema. Each event is handled through a function that extracts the relevant data and stores it in the subgraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.Example transformation:export function handleAssign(event: AssignEvent): void {\n  let entity = new Assign(event.transaction.hash.toHex() + \"-\" + event.logIndex.toString());\n  entity.to = event.params.to;\n  entity.punkIndex = event.params.punkIndex;\n  entity.save();\n}This logic creates an entity for each Assign event, generates a unique ID, and stores the event data in the subgraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.Querying the SubgraphOnce deployed, the subgraph exposes a GraphQL endpoint. Developers can then use this endpoint to query indexed data with high precision and performance.Example query to fetch recent transfers:{\n  transfers(first: 10, orderBy: blockTimestamp, orderDirection: desc) {\n    from\n    to\n    value\n    blockTimestamp\n  }\n}GraphQL queries are strongly typed and flexible, allowing developers to request exactly the data they need without over-fetching.Deployment OptionsThe Graph offers two main deployment options:Subgraph Studio (free, centralized): Best for development and testing. Includes a hosted playground and limited-rate endpoint (up to 3,000 queries/day).Graph Network (decentralized): Suitable for production deployments. Queries are served by decentralized indexers, with support for incentivization via the GRT token.The workshop covered how to deploy to Studio and test queries using the built-in GraphQL playground.Integrating with FrontendsSubgraph endpoints can be queried directly from modern web frameworks such as:React (via Apollo Client)Next.jsVue.jsSvelteThe Graph Studio also provides prebuilt query templates and code snippets to make integration fast and seamless.ResourcesThe Graph DocumentationSubgraph StudioMarcus Rein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Subgraph Workshop RepoMetis ExplorerLooking AheadIn our next session with The Graph, we will go deeper into subgraph development, covering:Working with multiple contracts in one subgraphAdvanced filtering and entity relationshipsPublishing to the decentralized indexing layerBest practices for query optimization and securityThese topics will help developers unlock even more from the data available on Metis.Stay ConnectedWe host technical workshops every week focused on tooling, infrastructure, and decentralized development within the Metis ecosystem.

This synthesis promises to address key challenges in both domains, enhancing the decentralization, transparency, and trust of AI systems while providing blockchain platforms with intelligence, adaptability, and enhanced functionality. This research article examines five prominent AI-blockchain solutions: Metis Hyperion with LazAI, Mode, Sahara AI, NEAR AI, and Bittensor. Each platform approaches this technological marriage differently, emphasizing various aspects of the AI-blockchain relationship while solving unique problems within this emerging space.MethodologyThis analysis compares these platforms across several dimensions:Technical architecture and performance capabilitiesAI integration approachGovernance and economic modelsDevelopment environment and toolingCore value propositions and target applications1. Metis Hyperion with LazAITechnical Architecture & PerformanceMetis Hyperion distinguishes itself through its real-time execution architecture with pipeline-based transaction processing that achieves sub-second finality. Its fully parallelized state root framework enables substantially higher throughput for AI operations, while providing immediate transaction feedback that delivers Web2-like responsiveness; crucial for real-time AI applications.The platform's MetisVM offers a true AI-native execution environment with several optimizations:JIT compilation that reduces execution costs by up to 30% for complex AI operationsCustom AI-specific opcodes including floating-point operations for model inferenceIntegrated hardware acceleration support (SIMD, GPU, TPU, FPGA)Parallel execution framework with optimistic concurrency control and DAG-based dependency resolutionAI IntegrationMetis Hyperion's approach to AI integration centers on on-chain inference capabilities, featuring:Native AI coprocessor acceleration enabling on-chain model inference without prohibitive gas costsState-aware caching optimized for AI model parameter access patternsAsynchronous I/O support for large AI model data flowsMulti-VM support with seamless integration with ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNXzkVM integration enabling privacy-preserving AI computations through zero-knowledge proofsData & Governance FrameworkLazAI's contribution includes a robust verification framework with a four-step validation process that guarantees AI data integrity. The Data Anchoring Token (DAT) System provides tokenized AI assets with verifiable provenance and programmable access control, while an iDAO (Individual-centric DAO) framework enables community-driven AI validation.Development ExperienceHyperion is using the MetisSDK, which is a specialized toolkit designed to enhance the performance of the network, by enabling parallel transaction execution. Rather than processing transactions sequentially (one after another), the MetisSDK allows multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously, leveraging modern multi-core processors to significantly speed up block processing. The MetisSDK released with these capabilities:Performance: Significantly faster block processing by utilizing multiple CPU coresCorrectness: Despite parallel execution, results are equivalent to sequential processingExtensibility: Support for custom extensions like AI servicesFurther Optimization: Optional bytecode compilation for even greater speedValue PropositionMetis Hyperion with LazAI positions itself as the most comprehensive blockchain infrastructure for sophisticated AI applications, specifically addressing the technical challenges that have previously limited blockchain's viability for AI workloads. Its value lies in combining real-time performance, AI-native execution capabilities, verifiable data governance, and developer-friendly tools.2. ModeTechnical Architecture & PerformanceAs a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network operating within the Optimism ecosystem (part of the \"Superchain\"), Mode leverages existing L2 scaling technologies. While specific performance metrics aren't detailed in the provided information, Mode cites being the \"third biggest ecosystem in the Superchain,\" implying substantial adoption and infrastructure.AI IntegrationMode's integration of AI focuses more on application-level functionality rather than protocol-level optimizations. Key components include:An AI-secured L2 sequencer for enhanced security monitoringOnchain agent infrastructure through partnerships with Olas, Giza, and RPS AIThe Synth Subnet project on Bittensor's network for generating synthetic price path dataEconomic Model & ProductsMode is creating what it terms the \"AIFi Economy\", an AI-enabled financial infrastructure and interfaces designed to scale DeFi to billions of users globally. Its product suite includes:Mode Trade: A comprehensive trading platform with perpetual trading, AI integration, and synthetic asset dataAI Terminal: A text-based command interface for simplifying complex trading operationsAIFi Wallet: A consumer-facing wallet application with AI-powered capabilitiesValue PropositionMode's unique value proposition centers on creating an ecosystem where AI agents and machine learning models can execute onchain transactions across DeFi protocols. The platform envisions a financial system powered by agent-to-agent (AI2AI) interactions, making DeFi more accessible through automation and improved usability.3. Sahara AITechnical Architecture & Data GovernanceSahara AI implements a four-layer architecture:Application Layer: User interface and interaction pointsTransaction Layer: Blockchain infrastructure for provenance and transactionsData Layer: For data storage, access, and transferExecution Layer: Off-chain infrastructure supporting AI computationThe platform establishes clear ownership of AI assets (data, models, agents) with transparent attribution and compensation mechanisms for contributors.Governance & Economic ModelSahara AI employs decentralized governance through the Sahara DAO with support from the Sahara Foundation. Its economic system defines specific roles (developers, knowledge providers, consumers, validators) and implements dual growth flywheels connecting Web3 and AI ecosystems.Value PropositionSahara AI's core value proposition is democratizing AI by addressing the current concentration of AI power among few organizations. The platform emphasizes sovereignty (user control over AI assets), provenance (transparent attribution), collaboration, privacy protection, and fair compensation. Its mission is to transform AI from a centrally controlled resource to one that empowers individuals, businesses, and communities worldwide.4. NEAR AITechnical Architecture & Privacy FocusNEAR AI's technical architecture centers on privacy-preserving technology and open-source infrastructure. Key technological components include:Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) using specialized hardware (Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs)Proof of Response mechanism to guarantee service liveness in decentralized systemsDecentralized Confidential Machine Learning (DCML) framework combining TEEs with payment channelsAgent Interaction and Transaction Protocol (AITP) for secure agent communicationAI Research & DevelopmentNEAR AI is building a 1.4T parameter frontier AI model (3.4x larger than Meta's Llama) using a decentralized approach with continuous competitions. The organization is also part of the Open Agents Alliance (OAA), collaborating with teams like Coinbase Onramp & AgentKit to deliver open-source AI services.Value PropositionNEAR AI's distinctive value proposition centers on \"User-Owned AI\", ensuring users maintain control of their data and AI interactions while making frontier AI models available in a permissionless fashion. The organization emphasizes privacy-preservation, sustainable monetization models for open-source AI, and global accessibility, aiming to provide AI services to all 5.5 billion internet users rather than just the current blockchain community.5. BittensorPeer-to-Peer Intelligence MarketUnlike the other platforms, Bittensor functions primarily as a decentralized market for machine intelligence rather than a traditional blockchain platform with AI features. Its core innovation is moving away from benchmark-based evaluation of AI toward a system where intelligence itself becomes a commodity that is mined, valued, and transacted.Technical Architecture & Network DesignIn the Bittensor network:Participants (called \"peers\") are neural networks that share representations across the internetPeers rank each other by measuring the value of signals they receiveA \"consensus\" mechanism ensures that peers must be trusted by over 50% of network stake to receive rewardsThe system incorporates bond ownership, conditional computation, and knowledge distillationValue PropositionBittensor's unique value proposition is creating an efficient market for machine intelligence through peer evaluation rather than centralized benchmarks. This approach aims to enable a more diverse ecosystem of AI systems that can find unique niches rather than competing in winner-takes-all environments. By making intelligence itself a tradable commodity, Bittensor potentially allows for more efficient production and valuation of AI capabilities.Comparative AnalysisTechnical Architecture ComparisonAI Integration ApproachConclusionThe convergence of AI and blockchain technology is still in its early phases, with each platform taking distinctive approaches to this integration. Metis Hyperion focuses on protocol-level optimizations for AI performance, with LazAI focusing on the data-alignment for AI through\u00c2\u00a0 through iDAO-driven governance, Mode targets DeFi applications with AI enhancements, Sahara AI emphasizes democratization and ownership, NEAR AI prioritizes privacy and user control, while Bittensor creates a marketplace for intelligence itself.These different approaches reflect the multifaceted nature of the AI-blockchain relationship and suggest that the space is still evolving toward optimal architectural patterns and business models. The success of these platforms will likely depend on their ability to deliver tangible value through actual applications while addressing the inherent challenges of both technologies.As the AI-blockchain ecosystem continues to mature, we can expect increasing specialization among platforms, with some focusing on specific vertical applications while others provide more general-purpose infrastructure. The convergence of these technologies holds significant promise for creating more transparent, accessible, and efficient AI systems while simultaneously enhancing blockchain functionality through embedded intelligence.Related PostTechnologyAccelerating Dapps and Decentralized Economies with Metis and CasperLabsEcosystemMetis EDF: A New Chapter for MetisFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

As Metis expands its innovative footprint in the Layer 2 ecosystem, clearly distinguishing Andromeda from Metis itself is critical. Andromeda isn't Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0094Metis forms the foundational layer of a broader ecosystem, paving the way for scalable decentralized infrastructure. Understanding the Difference: Metis vs. AndromedaAt first glance, you might mistake Andromeda as synonymous with Metis. Yet, clearly differentiating their roles is key to grasping Metis' expansive vision:Metis is not just another blockchain; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a comprehensive Layer 2 platform purposefully designed to address Ethereum's scalability, decentralization, usability, and interoperability challenges. Metis hosts specialized blockchain networks, each targeting unique market needs:Hyperion: An AI-driven execution layer optimized to support high-performance, computationally intensive AI inference applications.LazAI: A next-generation blockchain network and protocol specifically created to address the AI data alignment problem.Andromeda: A high-performance, Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network, specifically designed to support decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.Thus, Andromeda is a crucial piece\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not the entirety\u00e2\u0080\u0094of Metis' strategic vision, enabled by the powerful Metis SDK.\u00e2\u009a\u0099 Metis SDK: The Real Game ChangerAt the heart of Metis is the revolutionary Metis SDK, a developer-centric framework reshaping how blockchain networks are constructed and deployed. It unlocks unprecedented scalability, versatility, and interoperability\u00e2\u0080\u0094an all-in-one solution for building high-performance, real-time Web3 ecosystems.The Metis SDK doesn't transform the Metis token itself into a programmable asset, but rather, Metis provides developers with programmable tools through the SDK. This allows developers to build groundbreaking applications, advance decentralized infrastructure, and deliver exceptional user experiences.\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5 Hyperion: Showcasing Metis SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PotentialHyperion vividly demonstrates the transformative capabilities of the Metis SDK:Decentralized Sequencer Nodes: Decentralizing transaction sequencing to enhance network security and resilience.AI-Native Capabilities: Optimizing and supporting computationally intensive, on-chain AI inference applications\u00e2\u0080\u0094empowering developers to integrate advanced AI directly within decentralized applications.Parallel Transaction Execution: Speculative parallel execution dramatically boosts throughput and reduces latency, paving the way for real-time, responsive blockchain applications.Hyperion exemplifies the innovation and specialized networks that the Metis SDK enables.\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0096 LazAI: Contextualizing SDK FlexibilityWhile not the central topic of this discussion, it's valuable to mention LazAI briefly, as it underscores the SDK's versatility. LazAI is a protocol-layer infrastructure built to power a fully decentralized AI ecosystem where AI data, models, and interactions are verifiable, tokenized, and composable. Its modular three-layer architecture (Application, Execution, Extension) demonstrates another powerful, real-world example of what the Metis SDK can achieve.Specifically, LazAI leverages the Metis SDK to power its Execution Layer, utilizing an EVM-compatible LazVM to handle AI computations, gas settlements, and a robust decentralized Quorum-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u0094demonstrating the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader applicability beyond Hyperion and Andromeda.\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 Future Vision: Expanding the Metis SDK InfrastructureMetis is committed to continuous improvement and broader infrastructure expansion, with clear, tangible goals:Enhanced Decentralization & Security: Progressive decentralization via the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Network, ensuring network robustness and resistance to censorship.Cross-Chain Interoperability: Seamless integration through solutions like Metis Shared Bridge and Unified Account Abstraction, allowing smooth asset and data flow across different blockchain ecosystems.Further AI Integration: Continued growth in AI-driven solutions, building on successes from Hyperion and LazAI, solving real-world problems such as AI data alignment and computation complexity.Developer Initiatives: Strengthening support through extensive documentation, robust tooling, workshops, and developer-focused community initiatives.With these strategic expansions, Metis positions itself as the leading scalable, adaptable, and developer-focused Web3 infrastructure.\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u0090 Beyond Layer 2: Redefining ScalableClearly separating Andromeda from the overarching Metis ecosystem aligns perfectly with Metis' long-term scalable blockchain infrastructure strategy. Metis is not a singular Layer 2 solution\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is a multi-network ecosystem, fostering interconnected blockchain networks. By fostering interconnected networks, each tailored to specific use cases and communities, Metis redefines scalable blockchain infrastructure. With the innovative Metis SDK, this ecosystem gains a powerful platform to enable and thrive in a decentralized, multi-network future.In this multi-network ecosystem:Andromeda lays the decentralized, Ethereum-compatible foundational layer.Hyperion showcases the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities through AI-native application support.LazAI demonstrates versatility by addressing complex AI alignment challenges.These networks are initial demonstrations of the expansive possibilities unlocked by the Metis SDK.\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u008c Conclusion: Andromeda Is Only the BeginningClearly defining Andromeda as distinct from Metis highlights Metis' ambitious, strategic vision. Powered by the transformative Metis SDK, Andromeda provides the foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications. Hyperion and LazAI are groundbreaking proof points illustrating the vast potential for innovation within this ecosystem.This is only the beginning of a scalable, innovative, decentralized, multi-network blockchain future\u00e2\u0080\u0094an expansive vision clearly defined and driven by the Metis SDK.Welcome to a new era defined clearly by the Metis SDK.Related PostEcosystemMetis x Artemis: Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan for Stage 1CommunityMetis: Your One-Stop Network for NFTsFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

LazAI is working to ensure that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just aligned with human values but also open and accessible to everyone. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stepping into an exciting new chapter for Metis.With so much potential ahead of us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to pause and reflect. We shouldn't build just for the sake of building. We need to think about where this technology is taking us - and how we can shape it to create an ecosystem that delivers real value, not just for businesses but for everyday people too.Today, I want to talk to you - our amazing community - about one of Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core values: governance. I touched on this briefly at the ETHDenver kickoff, but now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to dive deeper. Not just into governance on Metis, but into something even more exciting: the vision of how people and AI can come together.BackgroundA quick recap of recent developments and announcements at Metis: 1. Metis ReGenesis is a refocusing of Metis on not only driving real value and use cases but also on the next step for the blockchain space \u00e2\u0080\u0093 AI. 2. As part of ReGenesis, we are launching a new chain to build a home for AI (Hyperion) that will coexist with Andromeda while incubating LazAI which will solve the data-alignment problem and democratization of AI assets. 3. Governance on Metis will evolve into more than a simple voting mechanism \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a gathering of discussions, ideas, and most importantly, the potential for action and thus value. 4. In exploring the applications of Alith, LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homegrown AI agent framework, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a chance to envision what is not only the potential but the ideal in which we may all work towards.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dig in, starting with the historical context.The Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and HumansPhilosophical RootsThroughout history, philosophers have sought to build societies where everyone feels free and happy. Many thinkers, from Socrates to modern philosophers, have debated governance models that balance power, virtue, and reason. Despite various societal advancements, no system has fully achieved this goal.One common thread among the great philosophers is that any society should be led or governed by highly educated, reasonable, and virtuous individuals who can predict the consequences of decisions and guide society toward prosperity, freedom, and happiness.Plato: Proposed the \"Philosopher-King\" model, arguing that the wisest and virtuous individuals should rule rather than those born into power or wealth. Only those with deep philosophical knowledge and rational thinking can govern justly, as they seek truth over personal gain.Aristotle: Advocated for the balance of wisdom, virtue, and participation. Insight: The best rulers are those trained in virtue, ethics, and reason, ensuring that decisions are made for the common good.Confucius. Confucian philosophy emphasizes that rulers must be wise, virtuous, and morally upright (the concept of Ren - benevolence).Immanuel Kant: Kant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s categorical imperative suggests that moral laws should be universal and based on reason rather than emotion or self-interest.The list doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end there, as the likes of John Stuart Mill, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Hayek, Yuval Noah Harari, and more have all come to similar conclusions. As shown, numerous great thinkers have all pointed towards the same idea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rulers must be wise, virtuous, and based on reason.Historical PrecedentsHistorically, some of the most successful governance models followed these philosophers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 insights:Singapore:\u00c2\u00a0 Lee Kuan Yew (Plato & Aristotle). He prioritized governance by highly educated and virtuous leaders. Singapore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government carefully selected and trained its leaders, ensuring that the most capable individuals made key policy decisions. Singapore transformed from a poor, unstable city-state in the 1960s to one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced economies.United States:\u00c2\u00a0 The Founding Fathers (Locke & Montesquieu). The U.S. Constitution was designed around Locke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, liberty, and property principles. A system of checks and balances (inspired by Montesquieu) was implemented to prevent tyranny and ensure governance by reason and law. Early American leaders like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton focused on education, rational governance, and long-term planning. The U.S. became the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful democracy, leading in innovation, economic growth, and individual freedoms.Switzerland:\u00c2\u00a0 Decentralized Governance (Montesquieu & Hayek). Swiss leaders prioritize rational, evidence-based governance, avoiding political extremes. Switzerland remains one of the wealthiest and most stable countries in the world.More examples: Germany in Post-WWII Reconstruction (Immanuel Kant & Hayek), South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scientific and Rational Leadership (Confucius & Locke), China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Technocratic Governance (Confucius & Legalism)AI as the Modern Philosopher-KingIn the present era, AI is the most educated \"individual\" in the world. It has vast knowledge, the ability to predict outcomes, and can offer valuable insights. However, it must not replace human governance but act as an advisor - a concept we call the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans.This tandem ensures AI serves as a highly educated advisor while humans retain decision-making power, applying ethical and emotional intelligence to any decision.Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Unique PositionMetis is uniquely positioned to implement the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans due to its commitment to decentralization across multiple layers:\u00c2\u00a0Decentralized Sequencers (MetisL2 & GOAT Network) - Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions, MetisL2 operates on a fully decentralized sequencer model, ensuring no single entity can control the network. This decentralized architecture naturally aligns with the ideology of distributed wisdom and fairness, preventing centralization risks in AI-assisted governance.Cross-Chain Reach - Metis is not confined to a single ecosystem. The upcoming Metis SDK allows seamless interoperability between other chains, and by bridging Ethereum (MetisL2), Bitcoin (GOAT), and other networks, Metis ensures interoperability and decentralization at a global scale that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confined to a single ecosystem.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0New Paradigm in AI Assetization and Democratization - With everything from verified computing, iDAOs (individual-centric DAOs) that manage these assets, DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) to allow accessible assetization while anchoring the full lifecycle of AI assets from models to agents, LazAI provides a holistic solution to the AI alignment problem. The core problem that LazAI is solving - the AI alignment problem - is the same core of the AI we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to ensure that true AI governance aligns with human needs and vision.The Meaning of Metis. In Greek, Metis (\u00ce\u009c\u00e1\u00bf\u0086\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0082) means wisdom, skill, or cunning intelligence. Metis's name was inspired by Greek mythology, where Metis was a Titaness of Wisdom, symbolizing the vision of an AI that enhances human wisdom rather than replacing it. This directly aligns with the ideology of a Balanced Tandem of AI and Humans, where AI serves as a knowledgeable advisor without exerting unchecked power.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0With this robust foundation in decentralization, cross-chain interoperability, and a commitment to ethical AI governance, Metis is not just another Web3 platform - it is the ideal proving ground for a decentralized AI-human collaboration model that can reshape governance, businesses, and societies for the better.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\nNo support\nSolving Real Problems Through AI-Human CollaborationThe Metis ideal of The Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans has the potential to solve a wide range of problems, spanning from global issues to smaller, yet impactful challenges within businesses and governance.Global Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveGlobal Political Inefficiencies & Misalignment with the PeoplesProblem: Governments often make uninformed, biased, or emotionally charged decisions that lead to war and economic disasters.Solution: AI can analyze historical data, predict geopolitical risks, and propose the best diplomatic strategies based on proven governance models. A decentralized, AI-assisted advisory system for world governance (similar to a non-corrupt UN) could reduce global conflicts by fostering educated, unbiased decision-making.Large-Scale Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveInefficiencies in National and Corporate GovernanceProblem: Many decisions are made based on limited knowledge, leading to policy failures and mismanagement.Solution: AI can study historical cases from the original philosophy books and historical archives of successful and failed governance, offering data-driven insights that help decision-makers predict long-term outcomes.Unstable Economic PoliciesProblem: Economic crashes and crises often result from poor financial planning and short-term decision-making.Solution: AI can analyze global economic patterns, advise governments and businesses on sustainable growth models, and help prevent reckless financial decision-making. AI access to real historical information is essential here.\u00c2\u00a0Smaller but Impactful Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveBusiness Decision-Making for Small EnterprisesProblem: Many small business owners lack the experience or resources to analyze market trends, competitors, and hiring strategies effectively.Solution: AI can predict market trends, suggest hiring decisions, and optimize business strategies, helping small businesses scale more efficiently. For instance, LazAI can help optimize business operations and strategies based on past performance, market trends, and best industry practices.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Decision-Making Challenges in DAOsProblem: Many DAO members lack the expertise to make informed governance decisions, leading to uninformed voting and low engagement.Solution: AI can educate DAO members on governance history, provide simulations of potential voting outcomes, and recommend the best courses of action. For instance, LazAI could analyze historical Metis CEG voting patterns, discussions, and Sybil activities, simulate outcomes of proposals, and recommend adjustments to maximize community benefit.\u00c2\u00a0The Metis Ideology of AI + Human Collaboration presents a scalable, adaptable framework to solve problems across multiple levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094from global governance to small business decisions.\u00c2\u00a0Risks and SafeguardsWhile this model presents significant advantages, robust safeguards are required to prevent AI misuse. Please note that a problem is an opportunity for us to find a new solution:AI Bias and NeutralityFlaw: AI models are trained on historical data, often containing biases. Even decentralized AI can inherit biases from the sources it learns from, leading to potentially flawed recommendations.Solution: Implement LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solutions where possible to ensure data and human alignment, and bias detection and mitigation mechanisms in the AI training process for non-LazAI data sources. Encourage diverse contributors to AI training and governance to minimize inherent biases.The Grand Vision: Creating a Free and Happy SocietyThe Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans is more than a concept\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is a path to a more just, free, and prosperous society. By integrating AI as an ethical and knowledgeable advisor, we can build an ecosystem where decisions are made with wisdom, ensuring freedom, growth, and innovation.Metis has already laid the foundation through LazAI and MetisL2 via Decentralized Sequencers. Now, our mission is to align all stakeholders around this vision and demonstrate its power in action.Metis is not just another Web3 economy - we are leading the charge toward a decentralized, AI-assisted future that balances intelligence with human ethics.We will create the future we believe in.\u00c2\u00a0Related PostEcosystemELI5: The Centralized Sequencer Problem in L2sCommunityCommunity Testing Season 2: Official GuideFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

What began as a race for transaction throughput has matured into a nuanced understanding that different blockchain applications require fundamentally different infrastructure optimizations. We at Metis recognized this reality, crafting a vision that transcends the limitations of single-network approaches.We are now bringing this vision to life by offering a decentralized infrastructure stack for the blockchain industry, starting with our dual-network strategy. At the core of this initiative is the MetisSDK, a new developer framework, alongside Hyperion (HYPE), a showcase chain currently under development to demonstrate the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential. The dual-network strategy integrates Andromeda, our established foundation layer, with Hyperion, a new AI-optimized performance layer. Rather than simply adding another chain to the ecosystem, this approach establishes a complementary infrastructure that unlocks previously unattainable capabilities within the Layer 2 landscape.In short, Hyperion and Andromeda will work together to serve both niches and the general blockchain space, creating synergies through innovations such as the Metis SDK, LazAI, and more. All of this, of ReGenesis is encapsulated in the Metis brand and value captured through a single token, creating a unified front in how Metis takes on the incumbent and new industries in the blockchain space.\u00c2\u00a0\"The multi-network architecture represents our understanding that no single chain design can optimally serve all Web3 applications,\" explains the Metis technical team. \"Specializing each network while ensuring seamless interoperability supports an ecosystem where developers can deploy different components of their applications to the chain that best suits each specific function.\"Andromeda: The Established FoundationMetis Andromeda was the first step in Metis' commitment to building scalable decentralized infrastructure, becoming our cornerstone network, offering reliable support for general-purpose decentralized applications. Using an optimistic rollup design, Andromeda delivers the security guarantees of Ethereum while significantly improving transaction throughput and reducing costs.The network has demonstrated particular strength in supporting DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and various applications where deterministic execution and proven track record are paramount. Its established decentralized sequencer network and battle-tested infrastructure make it the ideal foundation for applications where reliability takes precedence over extreme performance requirements.Andromeda's optimistic rollup implementation follows the time-tested approach of assuming transactions are valid until proven otherwise. This requires a fraud-proof window that maximizes security while still delivering substantial performance improvements over Ethereum's base layer. Current ecosystem participants include a diverse range of protocols and applications that benefit from this balanced approach.As Hyperion enters the ecosystem, Andromeda will continue its evolution, with ongoing optimizations to its core infrastructure, such as onchain data availability and a fraud proof system. However, its fundamental role remains unchanged: providing rock-solid infrastructure for general-purpose applications where established security models and deterministic execution matter most.Andromeda has full DSEQ nodes already, making it the clear choice for projects that prioritize security and decentralization. It continues to serve traditional DeFi use cases, and this positioning will remain unchanged.To top it all off, Andromeda will reach Stage 0 in the near future, with Stage 1 being the target by the end of the year.Hyperion (HYPE): Reimagining Layer 2 for the AI EraWhile Andromeda excels at general-purpose applications, Hyperion (HYPE) represents a specialized leap forward in blockchain architecture. Built on the Metis SDK, Hyperion's core is the high-performance MetisVM, which combines Ethereum compatibility with infrastructure explicitly designed for AI applications.Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions that merely iterate on existing designs, Hyperion addresses fundamental limitations that have constrained blockchain performance and creates barriers to adoption.MetisVM's technical breakthroughs are driving the next wave of innovation in blockchain and decentralized AI applications, featuring:Exceptional performance through advanced opcode processing and custom instruction extensions.Speculative and parallel execution powered by predictive algorithms for contract operations.State-aware caching to intelligently store frequently accessed smart contract state variables.Optimized inference engines, hardware acceleration, and zero-knowledge proofs for efficient and secure AI model operations within blockchain infrastructure.Hyperion is especially designed for high-performance computing applications that can benefit from AI, such as high-frequency trading, gaming, and DePIN, making it non-competitive with Andromeda.\"Aside from being a faster Layer 2, Hyperion is a fundamentally different approach to blockchain execution designed from first principles to support AI-native computation,\" notes Metis Executive Lead Tom Ngo. \"Applications that would be prohibitively expensive or simply impossible on traditional chains become viable through Hyperion's specialized architecture.\"Technical Innovations: How Hyperion Achieves Breakthrough PerformanceIn addition to MetisVM, Hyperion's performance advantages arise from three core technical innovations that work together to redefine Layer 2 capabilities.Optimistic Rollup with Parallel ExecutionTraditional blockchain execution processes transactions sequentially, creating an inherent bottleneck. Hyperion shatters this limitation through:Instant Transaction Finality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Achieves near sub-second settlement through Optimistic Commitments.Parallel Execution Engine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Smart contracts and transactions run concurrently, significantly increasing processing speed.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ensures Ethereum-grade security while reducing costs and delays.The combined effect transforms execution efficiency. Consider a DeFi application processing multiple swaps: where traditional chains would handle these sequentially, Hyperion executes them in parallel when they affect different liquidity pools. For AI applications performing multiple inference operations, the performance improvements scale even more dramatically.This approach maintains the performance benefits of sequenced transactions while eliminating the centralization risks that have plagued other high-performance networks.MetisDB: Next-Gen State Management SystemBlockchain performance relies on efficient state management, and Hyperion leverages MetisDB to enable instant state access, optimized transaction processing, and cost-effective data management.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0MetisDB achieves this through:Memory-Mapped Merkle Trees: Delivering near nanosecond-level state access for real-time applications.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Enabling parallel state updates for high-speed execution.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Asynchronous I/O Processing: Ensuring low-latency, high-throughput storage operations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0This innovative approach removes storage bottlenecks, enabling seamless execution of high-frequency blockchain transactions.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain InteroperabilityWhile pushing the boundaries of performance, Hyperion remains fully secured by Ethereum's settlement layer. State commitments are posted to Ethereum, ensuring that the network inherits the same security guarantees as the base layer.Hyperion is interoperable with multiple blockchain ecosystems, ensuring seamless cross-chain liquidity and data flow, it enables:\u00e2\u0080\u008dShared Bridge & Cross-Chain Connectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Enables multi-chain liquidity and interoperability.Decentralized Data & Compute Aggregation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Connects AI-driven applications, compute providers, and data networks.With this approach, Hyperion builds a seamless Web3 infrastructure, enabling scalable decentralized applications to interact across blockchain networks with security guaranteed by Ethereum.The Power of Metis SDK: Enabling the Dual-Network EcosystemAt the foundation of Hyperion (as well as LazAI) is the Metis SDK, a comprehensive development toolkit that enables seamless cross-chain interaction with high performance features and supports Hyperion's role as a liquidity hub in the broader blockchain ecosystem.The Metis SDK provides native tools for AI and high-performance dApps, making it significantly easier for developers to build AI-native applications without needing to manage complex blockchain interactions. This framework enables teams to create Metis-powered execution layers while overcoming underlying infrastructure challenges.SDK-driven standardization ensures compatibility between Andromeda and Hyperion, reinforcing the dual-chain architecture and enabling applications to easily span both networks when needed. This interoperability is crucial for the ecosystem's cohesive functioning.By leveraging the Metis SDK, developers can unlock new possibilities that elevate the entire blockchain ecosystem, creating applications that combine the security of established blockchain infrastructure with cutting-edge performance capabilities.Complementary Networks: Greater Than the Sum of Their PartsThe true innovation in Metis' approach lies not just in the individual networks but in how they complement each other. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, Andromeda and Hyperion are designed to work together seamlessly:Specialized Execution Environments: Developers can deploy core smart contracts on Andromeda for composability with the current ecosystem while routing computation-intensive protocols to Hyperion.Seamless Asset Movement: Assets can flow freely between networks through shared bridge infrastructure, creating a unified liquidity environment.Consistent Developer Experience: Similar tools and interfaces work across both networks, minimizing the learning curve for teams building on Metis.Additionally, asset interoperability will be maintained between both chains, forming a key part of the Dual-Chain Collaboration mechanism.\"The dual-network strategy creates natural expansion paths for projects as they evolve,\" explains Metis Executive Lead Tom Ngo again. \"Applications can start with standard functionality on Andromeda and gradually incorporate AI components through Hyperion as their needs grow, all while maintaining a unified user experience.\"Developer Experience and Use Case SuitabilityThe complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion creates a natural affinity for different application components:Andromeda is ideal for:Core financial contracts where proven reliability and composability is paramountLong-term data storage requiring maximum decentralizationTraditional DeFi applications with established execution patternsEnterprise applications requiring deterministic execution guaranteesHyperion excels at:AI-native applications requiring computational efficiencyHigh-frequency trading and complex DeFi operationsOnchain gaming with real-time interaction requirementsApplications with dynamic computational needsFor developers, the decision isn't binary\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's about strategic deployment across both networks based on component requirements. The Metis SDK abstracts much of the complexity, allowing teams to focus on application logic rather than network-specific implementations.Migration paths exist for integrating AI capabilities into existing Andromeda applications. Initial deployment on Andromeda provides stability and composability with established protocols while experimental features can be tested on Hyperion, creating a natural evolution path that minimizes risk while maximizing innovation potential.METIS Token: Unified Economic LayerThe METIS token sits at the center of this ecosystem architecture, meaning Hyperion is expanding Metis' capabilities rather than replacing Andromeda. METIS will capture value and maintain utility across both networks through multiple mechanisms:Native Gas Token: METIS serves as the native gas token for all transactions across both Andromeda and Hyperion, creating consistent demand regardless of which network users choose.Unified Value Capture: Transaction volume from AI-intensive applications on Hyperion and general DApps on Andromeda both contribute to token value in a unified economic system.Cross-Network Utility: Staking, governance, and other token functions work seamlessly across both networks, eliminating fragmentation of the token economy.This multi-chain approach ensures that as the ecosystem expands, METIS token utility strengthens proportionally across all network activities. New application categories enabled by Hyperion's specialized architecture create additional utility for the token, benefiting the entire ecosystem.\u00c2\u00a0It's important to note that Metis was initially issued on Ethereum, and the Metis token on Andromeda is not its native issuance\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is also the case for Hyperion.Long-term Ecosystem Growth StrategyOur dual-network strategy represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable ecosystem growth. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, the complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion creates natural expansion paths.\u00c2\u00a0This approach also insulates the ecosystem from market cycles by diversifying use cases across different technological domains. As general DeFi applications provide reliable baseline activity, AI applications drive innovation and new growth frontiers. The balanced, dual-network foundation aims to create long-term resilience while still enabling cutting-edge development.The strategy positions Metis uniquely in the Layer 2 landscape. Instead of fragmenting into competing chains or stretching single-network designs beyond their optimal use cases, Metis creates specialized environments that work together seamlessly. This approach aligns with enterprise requirements where different workloads routinely run on specialized infrastructure optimized for specific tasks.Implementation Timeline and Integration RoadmapHyperion's development and integration into the Metis ecosystem follows a structured timeline designed to ensure stability while introducing its enhanced capabilities:April - May 2025: Testnet LaunchMay - August 2025: Mainnet LaunchSeptember - December 2025: Mainnet UpgradesThroughout this rollout, Metis will provide comprehensive support for developers transitioning between networks, including documentation, grants for teams building cross-network applications, and technical assistance for optimization.Future Vision: Beyond the Dual-Network ModelWhile the dual-network architecture represents a significant advancement in Layer 2 design, our vision extends further into the future of blockchain infrastructure. The modular approach established by Andromeda and Hyperion creates a foundation for further specialization as new application categories emerge.Just as Hyperion was purpose-built for AI-native applications, future specialized execution environments could target other emerging workloads with unique requirements. This modular architecture positions Metis to rapidly adapt to shifting technological landscapes while maintaining the security and developer experience that form the core of its value proposition.The integration between Hyperion and LazAI, Metis' previously announced AI infrastructure, creates particularly interesting possibilities. As onchain AI applications mature, the synergy between these technologies will enable entirely new categories of decentralized applications that leverage both blockchain security and AI capabilities.Conclusion: Redefining the Layer 2 LandscapeThe introduction of Hyperion alongside Andromeda signals a fundamental rethinking of how Layer 2 solutions should evolve. By recognizing that different applications require different optimization priorities, we are creating an ecosystem architecture that delivers the best of both worlds: the proven security and stability of established Layer 2 technology alongside the cutting-edge performance needed for next-generation applications.This dual-network strategy positions Metis uniquely in the Layer 2 landscape. While other solutions force tradeoffs between security, performance, and decentralization, Metis allows developers to optimize each component of their application for its specific requirements. The result is an ecosystem that can simultaneously support traditional DeFi applications, enterprise workloads, and AI-native innovations without compromise.As blockchain technology continues its march toward mainstream adoption, the flexibility and scalability of our approach creates a foundation for sustainable growth. Solving the core challenges that have limited Layer 2 adoption\u00e2\u0080\u0094centralized sequencers, network congestion, and rigid economic models\u00e2\u0080\u0094allows us to build infrastructure capable of supporting the next wave of blockchain innovation.Rather than the future of Layer 2 being restricted to a single chain design optimized for all use cases, the dual-network approach is fostering a modular ecosystem where specialized networks work together seamlessly to enable applications that were previously impossible. With Andromeda and Hyperion, Metis is bringing that future into reality.Related PostTechnologyMETIS Incentives Live on SynapseTechnologyToken economics #1: Why do we need token economics, still?Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

His analogy resonated strongly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 traditional blockchain technology is comparable to a 3G wireless network, while Hyperion represents \"5G LTE and moving on to 6G.\" This isn't just an incremental improvement; it's a significant leap forward that addresses the fundamental limitations that have held blockchain adoption back in critical sectors.Reimagining AI for a Decentralized WorldNatalia shared our bold \"ReGenesis\" vision, which she powerfully described as \"a rebirth of Metis in the era of AI.\" She highlighted a pressing challenge in today's tech landscape: AI is developing within a \"centralized bubble\" where a handful of tech giants control our data, models, and algorithms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a situation that demands disruption.This is where blockchain technology becomes a game-changer. Our team envisions blockchain and AI as \"complementary and synergetic technologies,\" with blockchain having \"great potential to elevate AI, bring it to the next level, and help with addressing some of the key issues such as trust, verifiability, equal access.\" This is more than just improving technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's about democratizing the future of AI.Daniel cut through the noise to explain why Hyperion matters now: \"What we found was a gap in the industry where we saw that the needs of AI weren't really truly being met by any of the incumbents.\" Rather than chasing trends, Hyperion is filling a critical market need that no one else has properly addressed.Two Powerful Networks, One Unified EcosystemMany community members have asked how Hyperion will work alongside our established Andromeda network. Let's be clear: these networks are designed to complement each other, not replace one another. Tom explained this relationship thoroughly, noting that the two networks will operate in parallel, with Andromeda providing widespread access (like 3G) while Hyperion delivers specialized high-speed capabilities (like 5G/LTE) for specific high-performance applications.\"The two networks will work in parallel,\" Tom emphasized, with both powered by the METIS token. This is crucial to understand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion will use METIS as its gas token, and there are no plans to launch a separate Hyperion token. This creates a cohesive, unified ecosystem despite the different technical capabilities of each network.Daniel elaborated that Andromeda will continue as the trusted \"general purpose all use case Web3 network\" with its proven track record of decentralized sequencing (dSeq) and progression toward Stage 1, while Hyperion will serve \"almost like a halo\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 attracting attention and innovation with its high-performance capabilities specifically optimized for AI applications. Each network serves distinct needs within our growing ecosystem, creating synergies that strengthen the entire Metis ecosystem.Performance That Shatters ExpectationsHyperion's technical specifications aim to be industry-defining. With 1-2 gigagas per second processing power, Hyperion represents a giant leap in blockchain capabilities. Natalia explained what this means in tangible terms: \"unprecedented scalability, ultra-low latency, and also of course very high throughput\" creating advantages for both developers and users that simply weren't possible before.For everyday blockchain users, this delivers an \"almost Web2-like speed experience, which removes the lag and congestion and of course the high fees from blockchain interactions.\" For developers, it eliminates the constraints that have limited innovation, opening doors to applications that were previously unthinkable on blockchain.MetisVM: The Powerhouse Driving AI IntegrationAt the heart of Hyperion lies the groundbreaking MetisVM (Metis Virtual Machine), which Natalia described as \"a high-performance virtual machine developed to enhance the integration of artificial intelligence within a decentralized framework.\"While maintaining seamless compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), MetisVM introduces several advanced features specifically engineered for AI applications:Strategic separation of computing and storage functions for optimized performancePowerful support for parallel execution enabling unprecedented throughputHighly efficient dynamic code optimization reducing computational costsInnovative state-aware caching for faster data access and processingThese capabilities bridge the gap between blockchain and AI while creating \"an open and scalable decentralized infrastructure\" ensuring AI development remains \"transparent, verifiable, and aligned with human goals\" rather than controlled by centralized entities.Parallel Execution: The Key to Unlocking AI PotentialDaniel explained how Hyperion's parallel execution fundamentally transforms transaction processing, describing it as \"having multiple queues of transactions executing at the same time with mutual exclusion, while ensuring consistency between the results of serial and parallel execution.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis capability is absolutely critical for data-intensive AI applications, particularly model training that demands processing vast amounts of information simultaneously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a requirement that traditional blockchain architectures simply cannot meet.Real-World Applications That Will Transform IndustriesThe team highlighted several immediate applications that stand to be transformed by Hyperion's capabilities:Next-Generation DeFi and TradingTom emphasized how Hyperion will transform trading by solving the critical limitations in speed and throughput that have kept traditional finance from fully embracing blockchain. \"In traditional finance, trading timing is everything because the market moves fast,\" he noted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a challenge that Hyperion is uniquely positioned to address, potentially unlocking billions in traditional finance value.Unleashing High-Frequency Trading on BlockchainDaniel explained that high-frequency trading \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a multi-billion dollar industry in traditional finance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has been essentially impossible on blockchain due to network limitations. Hyperion changes this equation completely, potentially bringing this massive market segment into the blockchain ecosystem.AI Training and Inference at ScaleBy supporting onchain AI inference and machine learning models with unprecedented performance, Hyperion enables developers to create sophisticated AI applications with blockchain's security and transparency advantages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 applications that could fundamentally change how AI is developed, verified, and trusted.The Exciting Road AheadOur ReGenesis roadmap is accelerating quickly. Daniel shared that Hyperion's testnet is expected between late April and mid-May 2025, with the mainnet following around August. We're developing comprehensive campaigns for both users and developers to drive early adoption and showcase Hyperion's transformative capabilities.A key element of our strategy involves LazAI, which we're closely incubating. LazAI tackles the critical \"data alignment problem\" in AI, ensuring training data properly aligns with intended model outcomes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a perfect complement to Hyperion's infrastructure advantages.Daniel confidently articulated our vision: \"Regardless of how big we are and how big our competitors are, it's pretty much going to be irrefutable that Hyperion will be one of the top homes for AI,\" displaying the ambition behind this initiative and a clear-eyed assessment of the unique value Hyperion brings to the market.Be Part of the FutureMetis Hyperion represents an ambitious effort to create specialized blockchain infrastructure optimized for AI applications. By addressing the unique requirements of AI workloads through high-performance architecture, parallel execution, and optimized data handling, our roadmap aims to position Hyperion as the backbone of decentralized AI development.As Natalia concluded: \"Our vision is really to make Hyperion become the backbone of decentralized AI. But this is our vision, our approach. But it's up to you, our community, our supporters, and our developers to jump on that and really build it out and show what the new world with decentralized AI can look like.\"The future of blockchain-AI integration is taking shape now \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we invite you to be at the forefront of this exciting new frontier.Related PostTechnologyThe Buzz About BEES: Meme Token with a MissionEcosystemMetis Launches its DAOtribution Grants Campaign on KORIS!Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Traditional Layer 2 solutions, though an improvement over Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base layer, still struggle with congestion, centralized sequencers, and limited adaptability for AI-driven workloads.Hyperion (HYPE) is built to break through these limitations. Designed specifically for AI developers, DeFi protocols, and gaming applications, Hyperion is an ultra-fast, AI-optimized Layer 2 blockchain that eliminates the compromises of traditional rollup solutions. It introduces a high-performance modular rollup architecture, providing real-time execution, parallel processing, decentralized sequencing, and seamless Ethereum interoperability. With Hyperion, developers gain access to scalability without trade-offs, ensuring that complex applications perform at Web2-like speeds without sacrificing decentralization or security.Hyperion achieves 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions that will be available for AI engineers building in Web3.Hyperion vs. Andromeda: A Dual-Chain EcosystemHyperion is not replacing Andromeda, the existing Metis Layer 2 network, but rather expanding Metis' ecosystem with a specialized, high-performance infrastructure. While Andromeda serves as the general-purpose Layer 2 platform for Ethereum dApps, Hyperion introduces a more advanced modular rollup architecture tailored for high-frequency, AI-powered applications. This dual-chain strategy ensures that Metis can support the full spectrum of Web3 applications, offering tailored infrastructure solutions without compromise.Why Hyperion MattersLet's delve into why Hyperion is critical for the future of AI + Web3 applications and how its innovations solve fundamental issues that have long plagued Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.MetisVM: The AI-Optimized Virtual MachineAI applications require substantial computational power, and standard Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) are not designed to handle the high-performance execution demands of AI models. Hyperion introduces MetisVM, a custom-built virtual machine optimized for on-chain AI inference and high-throughput dApps.How MetisVM accelerates smart contract execution:Dynamic Opcode Optimization: Smart contract execution is enhanced with dynamically optimized opcodes, reducing gas fees and improving efficiency.Speculative & Parallel Execution: AI-powered dApps can predict, precompute, and execute certain actions in parallel, greatly increasing processing speed.State-Aware Caching: Instead of fetching redundant data repeatedly, MetisVM caches frequently accessed information, ensuring faster execution times for AI and high-performance applications.Why it matters: AI developers can now run machine learning models, inference engines, and data-driven smart contracts natively on-chain, something that was previously impossible without off-chain solutions.Instant, Parallelized Transaction Processing: Hyper-ScalabilityTraditional Layer 2 solutions operate using a sequential transaction execution model, creating performance bottlenecks under high demand. Hyperion introduces a Parallel Execution Engine with an Optimistic Rollup model that enables real-time, concurrent transaction processing, a necessity for AI driven, gaming, and high-frequency DeFAI applications.\u00c2\u00a0How Hyperion achieves real-time execution:Optimistic Model: Transactions are initially assumed valid and settled quickly, with fraud-proof mechanisms ensuring network integrity.Parallel Execution Engine: Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, Hyperion allows multiple transactions and smart contracts to execute at the same time, significantly reducing delays and increasing scalability.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms: Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions where fraud proofs can slow down execution, Hyperion optimizes fraud-checking processes, making the network both fast and secure.Why it matters: High-performance applications like on-chain AI, decentralized gaming, and real-time trading require sub-second execution times. Hyperion removes performance bottlenecks that have previously hindered Web3 innovation.MetisDB: Breaking the Blockchain Storage BottleneckBlockchain state management is a significant bottleneck for high-performance applications. MetisDB introduces an advanced storage system, enabling instant state access and cost-efficient data management.How MetisDB optimizes storage:Memory-Mapped Merkle Trees: Transactions are verified with near nanosecond-level state access, eliminating delays caused by slow storage retrieval.Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Allows simultaneous updates to blockchain state, avoiding bottlenecks in state modifications.Asynchronous I/O Processing: Storage read/write operations are optimized in real time, ensuring transactions complete faster without unnecessary computation delays.Why it matters: AI applications demand high-speed data retrieval and storage efficiency. MetisDB ensures that Web3 AI applications can scale without being slowed down by traditional blockchain state management issues.Ethereum Settlement & Seamless Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion is not an isolated blockchain, it is designed to be deeply integrated with Ethereum and the broader Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging periodic state commitments and cross-chain connectivity, Hyperion ensures that developers can build dApps that interact seamlessly across multiple networks ensuring that assets, liquidity, and data can flow freely across EVM chains.How Hyperion ensures cross-chain functionality:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: Hyperion periodically commits state changes to Ethereum, ensuring Ethereum-level security while maintaining cost efficiency. This means that all transactions on Hyperion ultimately derive security from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle-tested consensus model, providing finality and immutability without excessive fees.Shared Bridge & Multi-Chain Liquidity: Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared bridge framework facilitates the movement of assets and liquidity across multiple EVM compatible chains. This enables developers to create cross-chain AI models, gaming economies, and DeFi applications.\u00c2\u00a0Decentralized Data & Compute Aggregation: Hyperion integrates with off-chain compute networks, allowing AI applications to access external processing power while still maintaining the integrity of on-chain execution. AI developers can deploy high-compute inference models on-chain, leveraging distributed compute providers for enhanced scalability.Why it matters: AI and gaming developers need real-time, low-cost, and high-security environments to operate effectively. Hyperion ensures that developers can settle assets securely on Ethereum, move liquidity across multiple chains, and tap into decentralized compute power, creating truly scalable Web3 applications.Resistant, Reliable, and Fair Execution: Decentralized SequencingOne of the most persistent flaws in existing Layer 2 rollups is their reliance on centralized sequencers, which introduce risks of censorship, unfair transaction ordering, and single points of failure. Hyperion eliminates these vulnerabilities by implementing a Decentralized Sequencer Network that ensures resistance, reliability, and fairness in transaction processing.How Hyperion ensures fair execution:Leader Rotation Mechanism: Instead of relying on a single entity, Hyperion rotates sequencers dynamically, ensuring that no one party controls the network or influences transaction ordering.Timeout Failover: If a sequencer node goes offline or fails to validate transactions within a specified timeframe, another sequencer immediately takes over. This eliminates downtime and ensures uninterrupted transaction flow.MEV-Resistant Ordering: By leveraging encrypted mempools and Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), Hyperion eliminates front-running and ensures transactions are processed in the fairest possible order.Why it matters: Centralized sequencers in existing Layer 2s introduce trust assumptions that go against blockchain core principles. Hyperion ensures transactions remain censorship-resistant, unbiased, and free from manipulation, making it an ideal foundation for AI-driven automation and high-frequency financial applications. Users and developers no longer have to worry about network manipulation or censorship, making Hyperion a truly neutral execution layer.Conclusion: Hyperion - The Unstoppable Force of AI-Powered Blockchain InnovationHyperion is an evolutionary leap forward in Web3-powered AI future technology.

The space has seen major shifts, from the early ICO boom to the rise of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi. Each wave introduced new layers of utility, drawing attention and capital while laying the foundation for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next.\u00c2\u00a0Now, another powerful wave is forming: AI. Artificial Intelligence has transcended early expectations and hype cycles, proving its ability to drive real value across almost every domain including Web3. Similar to how DeFi experienced its hype cycle during DeFi Summer, but its core principles and applications have remained foundational. AI follows a similar trajectory: beyond speculation, it delivers real-world utility across industries, streamlining operations, improving decision-making, and unlocking new possibilities for automation.AI's impact isn't limited to a single use case. Whether it's predictive analytics, natural language processing, or decentralized autonomous agents, AI has an application in almost every sector. This broad applicability makes AI a compelling force in Web3, where efficiency, automation, and scalability are crucial.So why is Metis betting on AI? Because there is a clear gap in blockchain infrastructure that is capable of supporting AI-driven applications at scale. AI thrives on data, and blockchain offers a unique opportunity to provide transparent, verifiable, and decentralized data sources. By aligning blockchain with AI, Metis is creating an ecosystem where AI projects can operate more effectively and securely, while also benefiting from the decentralized principles that Web3 offers.Moreover, the timing couldn't be better. With the U.S. easing restrictions on AI and crypto, the regulatory landscape is becoming more favorable. This opens the door for rapid development and adoption. Web3 has been searching for its next big wave, and AI could be the catalyst to bring in mainstream adoption beyond just crypto-native users. Metis recognizes this opportunity and is positioning itself at the forefront of AI-powered blockchain innovation, ensuring AI has everything it needs to scale within Web3.But recognizing the opportunity is not enough. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive deeper into the \"why.\" Why is Metis taking this bold step?\u00c2\u00a0Our Strategy: Bridging the Gap in AI + CryptoThe intersection of AI and blockchain is still in its infancy, and while many blockchain projects acknowledge AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential, most are missing the mark entirely. Instead of addressing the real infrastructure challenges that AI developers face, they are throwing money at the problem, hoping hype will be enough to carry them forward. This kind of strategy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fall short, it creates systemic risk, leading to unsustainable bubbles similar to the 2000 dot-com crash or the speculative DeFi boom of 2021.Where Others Are Falling ShortGrants & Hackathons \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Many blockchain projects are resorting to grants and hackathons, believing that a burst of developer activity will lead to meaningful AI adoption. But this is just temporary engagement, without long-term infrastructure, these projects have nowhere to go after the funding runs dry. What happens when the incentives end? The builders leave, and the so-called AI revolution on these chains fizzles out.New AI-Focused Layer 1s \u00e2\u0086\u0092 The most dangerous trend in AI+Crypto is the sudden emergence of AI-focused Layer 1 blockchains. While this may seem like a bold innovation, it is an incredibly high-risk gamble. History has shown that launching a new Layer 1 is difficult, most fail to achieve critical mass, leading to abandoned ecosystems and wasted developer effort. If these AI-specific chains fail, every project built on them is at risk. The foundation crumbles, and the entire ecosystem collapses with it.Minor Token Upgrades \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Adjusting tokenomics to \u00e2\u0080\u009cincentivize AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d without addressing fundamental technical limitations is a band-aid, not a solution. Some networks slap AI-related buzzwords onto governance models, tweak a few incentive mechanisms, and claim they are AI-ready.The result? A chaotic landscape where projects are chasing hype rather than building sustainable AI ecosystems. If this trend continues, a handful of projects may survive, but without fundamental infrastructure, the majority will struggle to gain real adoption.AI developers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need more speculative schemes, they need robust, scalable infrastructure that allows them to deploy real applications. Very few blockchain projects are focusing on the actual computational demands of AI: high-speed processing, decentralized storage, and secure data verification.Metis understands these pitfalls and is taking a fundamentally different approach, one that goes beyond throwing money at the problem. Instead, Metis is focused on providing the infrastructure AI projects actually need to scale. This is where our two-pronged strategy comes into play.Our Commitment: A Two-Pronged ApproachMetis is not just another blockchain chasing the AI hype, we understand the real gaps in the industry, and we are building to address them. AI models are data-intensive, high-speed, and demand real-time computation. Traditional blockchains weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built for this level of execution. Developers need an environment where their AI applications can actually run without breaking.Our approach is grounded in delivering actual utility for AI builders by focusing on two critical areas:1. Providing Infrastructure AI Developers NeedBuilding AI-native applications is about giving developers the infrastructure they actually need to scale AI on-chain. AI projects require a high-performance execution layer, reliably high throughput, and a seamless developer experience. Without these, AI simply cannot function effectively on blockchain. This is exactly what Metis provides.\u00c2\u00a0High Throughput & Low Latency: AI workloads aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like standard Web3 applications. They require constant iteration, rapid processing, and fast decision-making. Whether it's AI-driven trading, autonomous agents executing contracts, or real-time DeFi optimizations, speed is everything. High transaction finality and low-latency execution are non-negotiable.A Stable, Reliable Network: AI-driven applications rely on consistency. Unlike human users, who can adapt to occasional congestion or high fees, AI models need a predictable and stable execution environment. If AI models experience unpredictable gas fees, downtime, or network congestion, their decision-making becomes flawed.\u00c2\u00a0Infrastructure Beyond Blockchain: AI applications require an ecosystem, not just a chain. For AI to be truly effective in Web3, developers need access to decentralized compute, storage, and indexing services. Without these services, AI developers struggle with fragmented data silos.2. Solving AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hardest Problems: Data MisalignmentOne of the most pressing issues in AI today is data misalignment, the inability of AI systems to align with human values and intentions due to flawed or incomplete training data. AI models rely on supervisory signals to learn, but these signals are often corrupted or missing, leading to outputs that fail to address real-world needs or ethical considerations. This results in AI-generated misinformation, bias, and hallucinations, issues that degrade trust and limit AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usability in high-stakes applications.Metis, through its incubation of LazAI, is directly addressing these issues. By leveraging blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparency and verifiability, LazAI ensures that AI models can access structured, high-quality, and decentralized data sources. This not only mitigates data misalignment but also provides an open and collaborative ecosystem where AI applications can function with greater trust and reliability.Additionally, AI projects require interoperability and ease of integration with Web3 ecosystems. Metis has developed Alith, a blockchain-native AI agent framework through LazAI, enabling AI-powered applications to seamlessly function across multiple networks. This enhances their usability, adaptability, and real-world applicability, making it easier for AI models to integrate with decentralized finance, governance, and gaming platforms.The Future of AI & MetisThe fusion of AI and blockchain is only just beginning, and the possibilities ahead are vast. The same way DeFi transitioned from a speculative experiment into an essential component of every blockchain, AI will become a native intelligence layer that powers everything from on-chain automation to real-time decision-making and beyond.But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the key: AI needs a home built for it.For AI to fully integrate into Web3, it requires an environment that matches its computational needs, eliminates friction, and allows it to operate without barriers.\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what Metis is enabling.By building an ecosystem designed specifically to support AI, Metis is not just addressing the challenges of today, we are setting the foundation for the innovations of tomorrow. AI thrives when it has the right infrastructure to grow, and with Metis, AI developers are no longer constrained by network limitations, computational inefficiencies, or unreliable data sources.The future is not about forcing AI to adapt to blockchain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about giving AI the home it deserves, one where it can truly scale, explore, and redefine what is possible in the decentralized world. Metis is leading this charge, ensuring that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another trend in Web3, but a fundamental force shaping the next era of innovation.Related PostCommunityIntroducing the Metis Business Development Bounty ProgramEcosystemMetis Expands Its Presence in South Korea with a Listing on BithumbFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

This initiative is designed to reward loyal community members, enhance user engagement, and solidify the Metis DeFi ecosystem's growth in collaboration with Artemis Finance.As a pivotal part of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer (DSEQ) Reboot program, this plan ensures that 4,000 oMETIS are allocated to Art-Points holders, recognizing their valuable contributions and ongoing support of the Artemis ecosystem.What Are Art-Points?Art-Points represent users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activity and contributions within the Artemis ecosystem. This innovative points system enables fair and transparent rewards based on engagement and participation. The longer users stay engaged, the higher the rewards they can earn.Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan: Timeline and RewardsTo begin earning Art-Points all you need to do is connect your wallet and deposit METIS directly on Artemis. Rewards will be distributed in three specific periods, with only newly earned points during each period being eligible for rewards. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works:Period 1: February 29, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 July 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward the rewards for Period 1.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not be eligible for Period 2 rewards.If you accumulated 100 points during this period, you will receive rewards based on your contribution to the total points pool.Period 2: July 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 October 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Only points earned during this period will be eligible for rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not accrue new points and therefore will not qualify for Period 2 rewards.If you retained some artMETIS and accumulated 50 points in this period, your rewards will be proportional to those 50 points.Period 3: October 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 January 24, 2025Reward Pool: 1,600 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward Period 3 rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before October 1, you will not qualify for rewards in this period.If you accrued 50 points during Period 3, you will receive rewards proportional to those 50 points.Please note that Art-Points are not tracked for short-term campaigns, such as the new Nitro Pool in Hercules or the Binance Web3 Wallet campaigns, which offer their own unique rewards. As a result, users participating in these campaigns are not eligible for oMETIS rewards.Why This Matters for Metis and Artemis EcosystemsThe Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan is a strategic effort to reward active participation and maintain strong user engagement within the Metis-Artemis ecosystem. This initiative not only recognizes the efforts of loyal users but also creates a sustainable foundation for:Enhanced Liquidity: Incentivizing long-term participation increases liquidity in the ecosystem.Community Growth: Rewards encourage both new and existing users to stay involved and continue contributing.Ecosystem Alignment: By linking rewards to real activity, we ensure that incentives align with the health and sustainability of the Metis ecosystem.How to Claim Your RewardsArt-Points holders can claim their rewards directly through the Artemis dashboard after each period ends. Remember, only points earned during the designated period will count toward rewards for that specific timeframe.Looking Ahead: Building a Stronger DeFi EcosystemAt Metis, we are committed to supporting innovative projects like Artemis Finance that center users and drive ecosystem growth.

From the outset, we embraced innovation that dared to challenge conventions, setting us apart as an outlier among Layer 2 solutions. This spirit of ingenuity has driven us to take bold steps, face challenges head-on, and stay true to our mission: scaling Ethereum while championing decentralization and groundbreaking innovation.Over time, this commitment has solidified Metis as more than just a network\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movement. Our novel strategies stem from a deep respect for Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundational values and an unwavering desire to push the boundaries of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible. Alongside our community, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created a unique space for collaboration and inclusivity within the Ethereum ecosystem.As we move into 2025, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doubling down on our vision to demonstrate that being different doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean straying from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethos - we intend to bolster Ethereum and its Layer 2 viability, and provide solutions through new technology. Through deliberate and thoughtful upgrades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bridging innovation with tradition, showcasing how a Layer 2 chain can balance forward-thinking technology with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core principles. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fortifying our infrastructure to ensure Metis becomes the most attractive and reliable destination for projects and users.This year is about blending the best of Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cypherpunk origins with the fearless creativity that defines Metis. Together, we will continue to break new ground, strengthening our position as a key contributor to Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. With collaboration,creativity , and a shared sense of purpose, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a network that embodies the very essence of innovation, community, and authenticity. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scale new heights, together.1. Quick Recap of Metis ArchitectureMetis is an L2 with optimistic architecture on Ethereum, offering:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fast and cheap L2 transactions\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Security anchored on Ethereum\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decentralized sequencers\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fraud proofs and DA enhancements in early 2025 (Q1)Fraud proofs prevent invalid state from persisting on L2, while data availability ensures enough transaction data is posted to Ethereum so watchers can reconstruct and validate L2 state transitions.With the sequencer layer decentralized, the next step (Q3) is to achieve full EVM equivalence and keep the L2 environment synced with the latest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) features and upgrades.2. Q1: Fraud Proofs & Data Availability (EIP-4844 Blobs)Fraud proofs are a cornerstone of ensuring the security and integrity of any Layer 2 blockchain. They empower network participants, commonly referred to as watchers, to challenge invalid L2 state roots or transactions. This mechanism ensures that even in the presence of malicious actors, the network remains resilient and trustworthy. The fraud proof process provides a transparent, on-chain method for resolving disputes, making it an essential feature of a decentralized Layer 2 ecosystem.Data Availability (DA) is vital for every Layer 2 blockchain, ensuring transaction and smart contract data remains secure, verifiable, and accessible. It underpins trust, transparency, and seamless interaction within the ecosystem.In April 2022, to reduce transaction costs, Metis transitioned its DA from Ethereum to Memo Labs, making us one of the most affordable L2 networks. This strategic move lowered barriers to adoption and enabled greater scalability.With Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Proto-Danksharding upgrade introducing cost-effective L1 blobs for temporary data storage, the DA landscape has evolved. This advancement allows Metis to align with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest innovations, enhancing affordability, decentralization, and performance.2.1 Fraud ProofsFraud proofs empower watchers to challenge any invalid L2 state root or transaction. The high-level flow:\u00c2\u00a01. Batch Proposal: A proposer (any sequencer node in the decentralized set) sends a batch of L2 transactions/state roots to Ethereum.\u00c2\u00a02. Challenge Window: A time window (e.g., 7 days) allows watchers to submit fraud proofs if they detect invalid state transitions.\u00c2\u00a03. \u00c2\u00a0Onchain Dispute: The fraud proof contract on L1 replays the disputed transaction(s) to check correctness.\u00c2\u00a04. Slashing & Reversion: If the state is found fraudulent, the batch is reverted, and the malicious proposer is slashed.Impact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Increases network security\u00e2\u0080\u0094invalid state cannot persist without being challenged.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Distributes trust\u00e2\u0080\u0094anyone can become a watcher and help secure the network.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Aligns Metis with other optimistic rollups that rely on L1-based dispute resolution.Below is a simplified example of a fraud-proof contract:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title FraudProofVerifier\n * @notice Illustrative contract to demonstrate a simplified fraud proof mechanism\n */\ncontract FraudProofVerifier {\n    // Batch index -> state root\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public batchStateRoots;\n\n    // Whether the batch is under dispute\n    mapping(uint256 => bool) public isUnderDispute;\n\n    event StateRootProposed(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot);\n    event FraudProofSubmitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, address indexed challenger);\n    event BatchInvalidated(uint256 indexed batchIndex);\n\n    function proposeStateRoot(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot) external {\n        require(batchStateRoots[batchIndex] == 0, \"State root already set\");\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = stateRoot;\n        emit StateRootProposed(batchIndex, stateRoot);\n    }\n\n    function submitFraudProof(uint256 batchIndex, bytes calldata proofData) external {\n        require(!isUnderDispute[batchIndex], \"Batch already disputed\");\n\n        // Validate the proof data\u00e2\u0080\u0094replay or merkle-check the L2 transaction\n        bool isFraudulent = _verifyProof(proofData);\n\n        require(isFraudulent, \"No fraud detected\");\n        isUnderDispute[batchIndex] = true;\n        emit FraudProofSubmitted(batchIndex, msg.sender);\n\n        // Invalidate the batch if the proof is valid\n        _invalidateBatch(batchIndex);\n    }\n\n    function _verifyProof(bytes calldata proofData) internal pure returns (bool) {\n        // In a real implementation, you'd decode transactions, check state transitions, etc.\n        // Here, we return true for demonstration\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function _invalidateBatch(uint256 batchIndex) internal {\n        // For demonstration, revert the batch state root\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = bytes32(0);\n        emit BatchInvalidated(batchIndex);\n    }\n}\n2.2 Data Availability with EIP-4844 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlobs\u00e2\u0080\u009dEIP-4844 introduces \u00e2\u0080\u009cblob\u00e2\u0080\u009d transactions that store data cheaply and temporarily on Ethereum. This approach reduces L2 fees because data posting to Ethereum mainnet becomes more cost-effective than older calldata methods.How Metis Uses Blobs\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Blob Commitments: The Metis sequencer (now decentralized) bundles L2 user transactions, compresses them, and posts them as blobs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Verification: The rollup contract on L1 holds a commitment (e.g., KZG polynomial commitment) to the blob data. Anyone can fetch the actual data from the blob to verify correctness if they need to submit a fraud proof.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Reduced Costs: Because blobs are cheaper to post and ephemeral, overall L2 gas costs drop for end users.A conceptual snippet that tracks blob commitments on-chain might look like this:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title DataAvailabilityRegistry\n * @notice Stores commitments (hashes or polynomial commitments) to EIP-4844 blobs\n */\ncontract DataAvailabilityRegistry {\n    // batch index -> blob commitment\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public blobCommitments;\n\n    event BlobCommitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 commitment);\n\n    function storeBlobCommitment(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 commitment) external {\n        // In practice: verify the caller is an authorized sequencer or aggregator\n        blobCommitments[batchIndex] = commitment;\n        emit BlobCommitted(batchIndex, commitment);\n    }\n\n    function validateBlobData(uint256 batchIndex, bytes memory rawData) public view returns (bool) {\n        // In real usage, you'd do a KZG polynomial check or a Merkle check\n        return keccak256(rawData) == blobCommitments[batchIndex];\n    }\n}\nImpact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower Fees for L2 users, because posting data to L1 is the most expensive part of running an optimistic rollup.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Improved Transparency, as watchers can easily fetch the data from Ethereum for fraud proof purposes.3. Q3: Full EVM Equivalence & Staying Updated with the Latest EVM VersionThe current Metis EVM, as of the time of writing, operates at the Berlin (+PUSH0) version. However, it lags behind Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving EVM, which has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years. These upgrades include the London, Paris, Shanghai, Cancun, and the soon-to-be-released Pectra versions, each of which introduces critical improvements that enhance the Ethereum ecosystem.3.1 What Is EVM Equivalence?An EVM-equivalent rollup means the L2 runtime matches Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM specification exactly (or as close to 1:1 as possible) so that:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 All opcodes, gas metering, and execution semantics behave as they do on mainnet.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers can use the same tooling (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, Remix) without modification or custom compilers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Deploying a contract on Metis works the same way as deploying it on Ethereum, minimizing surprises.\u00c2\u00a0Note: Some older L2s are \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-compatible\u00e2\u0080\u009d but not fully \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-equivalent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which can cause subtle differences in gas usage, block gas limits, or opcode availability. Metis aims to eliminate these discrepancies in Q3 2025.3.2 Catching Up to the Latest EVM VersionEthereum undergoes frequent upgrades\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., Shanghai, Canc\u00c3\u00ban, or future hard forks that might introduce new opcodes or behaviors. Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q3 upgrade is designed to:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Integrate new EVM opcodes introduced on mainnet (e.g., PUSH0 from Shanghai).\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Match Gas Schedules so that on-chain execution cost is consistent with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost model.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Adopt Protocol Upgrades so that any features or bug fixes in the main Ethereum client are also reflected on Metis.A trivial example of using the PUSH0 opcode (introduced in Shanghai/Shanghai-like forks) in inline assembly is shown below (Solidity 0.8.20+). This opcode pushes a 0 value to the stack:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.20;\n\ncontract ExamplePush0 {\n    uint256 public someValue;\n\n    function usePush0() external {\n        assembly {\n            // push0 places 0 on the stack\n            push0\n            // sstore at slot 0 (someValue) with the top of the stack (which is 0)\n            sstore(someValue.slot, 0)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dOn older EVM implementations that lack PUSH0, this contract would fail to compile or revert at runtime. With Q3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM equivalence update, Metis ensures that the same contract runs identically to Ethereum mainnet.3.3 Benefits & Impact of Full EVM Equivalence\u00c2\u00a01. Developer Experience:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No special compilers or config.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Off-the-shelf Ethereum libraries (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js) work seamlessly.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Faster onboarding of new devs or migrating existing mainnet projects to Metis.2. Tooling & Debugging:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat and Foundry can test and debug using the exact same environment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Less friction for advanced debugging or performance analysis.3. Easier Cross-Chain Bridges:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bridging logic can rely on consistent EVM state transitions and proofs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fewer edge cases and less custom code to maintain for bridging solutions.4. Rapid Upgrades:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Because Metis stays in sync with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upgrades, new features introduced on Ethereum can quickly be adopted on L2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Future merges, forks, or EIPs won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause large divergences in the codebase.5. User Adoption:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decreased confusion for end users about \u00e2\u0080\u009chow is L2 different from L1.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 More reliability, fewer failures when porting dApps over to L2.4. Putting It All Together\u00c2\u00a01. Decentralized Sequencers: Already implemented in Metis to reduce the single point of failure. Anyone meeting the requirements can join the set of sequencers and propose L2 blocks.\u00c2\u00a02. Fraud Proofs (Q1): Provide a robust challenge mechanism on L1, ensuring malicious or incorrect state transitions can be disputed and reverted.\u00c2\u00a03. Data Availability via Ethereum Blobs (Q1): Leveraging EIP-4844 for cheaper, ephemeral data posting, thereby lowering gas fees for L2 transactions and improving accessibility for watchers.\u00c2\u00a04. Full EVM Equivalence (Q3): Updating the entire Metis stack to match Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest EVM version, ensuring 1:1 opcode coverage, gas metering, and developer tooling compatibility.5. Practical Considerations & Migration\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Node Operators: Must upgrade their Metis nodes in Q3 to the new software version that supports the latest EVM changes.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Existing contracts should \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but if you rely on newly introduced opcodes (e.g., PUSH0), you can only use them post-upgrade.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat or Truffle can be configured with the same compiler version used on mainnet, simplifying the pipeline.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Watchers: Should remain vigilant, especially during the Q3 transition, verifying that the upgraded L2 environment is producing valid state roots.6. ConclusionBy Q3 2025, Metis will have:\u00c2\u00a01. Deployed Fraud Proofs (Q1) and ensured robust dispute resolution on L1.\u00c2\u00a02. Adopted EIP-4844 Blobs (Q1) to lower data posting costs, thereby reducing user gas fees and boosting throughput.\u00c2\u00a03. Fully Aligned with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM (Q3), guaranteeing EVM equivalence so that developers can deploy, test, and maintain contracts as if they were on mainnet.These milestones reinforce Metis as a performant, decentralized, and user-friendly optimistic rollup. The Q3 focus on full EVM equivalence underscores Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to staying on the cutting edge of Ethereum development, ensuring a frictionless developer experience and the highest degree of compatibility with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving ecosystem.\u00e2\u0080\u008dDisclaimer: The details, timelines, and implementation specifics are subject to change based on final Metis team announcements.
