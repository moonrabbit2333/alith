While they promise decentralization and scale, many rely on a single sequencer to control the flow of transactions. This creates a bottleneck that weakens censorship resistance, erodes trust, and raises new regulatory concerns.Metis planned ahead and made a different choice. We built the first live Decentralized Sequencer on Metis Mainnet. It aligns with a future where L2s act as public infrastructure.What is a Decentralized Sequencer\u00c2\u00a0Here is the simple idea. Ordering works better when more than one qualified operator shares the job under clear, onchain rules. If one operator slows down, others keep the flow going. Control spreads out, so no single party can hold the switch.The Metis FlowIndependent operators receive transactions in a shared queue. Public rules that weigh stake and performance select a proposer for the next block. The group checks that proposal and agrees on the same order. A signed batch with its data is then posted to Ethereum so anyone can verify and challenge if needed.This design reduces pauses when a single machine fails. It limits opportunities for selective inclusion. It gives partners, institutions, and regulators a clearer story because ordering follows open rules.How It Works in PracticeOperators stake METIS and rotate through proposer duties using BFT consensus (Tendermint style). Each batch gets signed through MPC and posted to Ethereum where anyone can verify or challenge it.\u00c2\u00a0This setup spreads ordering power across a community of stakers instead of concentrating it in one entity. The result: predictable execution, credible neutrality for institutions, and a network committed to productive security work instead of sitting idle.The Regulatory Advantage of MetisWhen one entity controls transaction ordering, regulators can classify it as an exchange. Metis avoids this by distributing control across multiple staked operators.Peirce's comments confirm what we've built: decentralized sequencing keeps L2s in the infrastructure category, not the securities regulation zone.The Broader Metis StackThe sequencer is one pillar. Andromeda strengthens the posture with the following pieces:Ethereum-Based Data Availability via EIP-4844 Blobs. Posting data to Ethereum improves transparency and auditability while keeping costs in check.Fraud Proofs. Anyone can challenge invalid state. Disputes resolve on L1 with slashing for malicious actors.MPC Signing. Multiple parties collaborate to sign transaction batches, eliminating single points of failure in the signing process.Together these parts move the network toward full decentralization with Ethereum-anchored security and practical throughput for modern applications.What is a Metis SequencerMetis sequencers are the node operators who run the decentralized infrastructure. They can:Join by staking METIS and running the required node operator software. Responsibilities are published and testable onchainEarn rewards for reliable participation and performanceRotation and consensus rules reduce ambiguity and share responsibility across several operatorsProven misbehavior can lead to penalties through slashing under the protocol's rulesTrack uptime and latency so you can improve service quality over timeGet InvolvedDecentralized sequencing is already live on our mainnet, backed by open rules and staked responsibility.If you're interested in joining the effort, submit a proposal to become a Metis sequencer on the Governance Forum. Every operator strengthens the network and shapes the future of decentralized infrastructure.Related PostTechnologyThe Dual-Network Strategy: How Metis Andromeda and Hyperion Are Reshaping Layer 2 InfrastructureCommunityCommunity Highlights: Meet the Builders Shaping Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Hyperion Testnet EcosystemFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

A small set of platforms decides what data goes in, who benefits from the outputs, and which values get encoded.\u00c2\u00a0People, teams, and institutions contribute the raw material that makes AI useful, but they rarely hold the keys. If alignment is about serving human intent, then the people who create the value need a direct way to govern it.We take a simple approach to implement this: put individuals first, then scale. Treat every dataset, model, and agent as an ownable, governable asset with clear provenance and programmable permissions, with governance pushed to the edge where creators set policy.The structure that makes this possible is the iDAO. iDAO will roll out on LazAI, built on Metis infrastructure.What is an iDAO?An Individual-centric DAO (iDAO) is a lightweight ownership and governance shell around your AI assets. It is the social and economic home for a dataset you curate, a model you train, or an agent you operate.\u00c2\u00a0Inside that shell, members set and update governance policies, those rules are enforced onchain. You connect to applications, and you share in the value your assets create. iDAOs turn contributions into governed property that can be trusted, reused, and rewarded.Powered by METISiDAO launches on LazAI and will be powered by Metis infrastructure. Andromeda is the production Layer 2 where iDAO activity will settle and gas is paid in METIS. While Hyperion is the high-throughput testnet for agent-heavy experiments; with transaction settlement also being in METIS.\u00c2\u00a0On this stack, DAT mints, permission updates, and reward distributions execute with gas covered in METIS, giving you verifiable records, programmable access, and a path to scale without giving up control.Integrating into the LazAI toolkitLazAI supplies the rails that make iDAOs practical. Governance changes, such as policy updates or parameter votes, are executed through the iDAO. On testnet these flows are exercised and validated, with production settlement on Andromeda. Alith is the unified access layer that lets contributors submit data, models, or agent updates. All iDAO onchain steps settle on Metis and use METIS as gas.A Verifiable Service Coordinator routes those updates to trusted validator quorums.\u00c2\u00a0Once verified, the update is anchored, the DAT reflects the new state, and future usage can share value with the iDAO that made it possible.Every step is visible onchain, which builds confidence for partners and downstream users.Aligning AI incentivesPutting assets inside iDAOs changes incentives. Contributors keep authorship and set the terms. Applications gain reliable, permissioned inputs with clear provenance.\u00c2\u00a0Communities can specialize around domains and steadily improve quality because better inputs create better models, which attract more usage and send more rewards back to the people doing the work. Alignment becomes an economic property. What iDAOs unlock in Web3 AI:Personal and domain AI that stays accurate. Provenance is built in, so context is portable and improvements compound.Clear paths to monetization. Rewards flow when assets are used, not only when they are sold.Trust at scale. Validation is transparent and tamper-resistant, which lowers the cost of cooperation across teams.Composability. iDAO assets plug into EVM tooling on Metis, so they can move across agents and apps without losing history.Get involvedIf you create data, train models, or run agents, an iDAO gives your work a home and a voice.\u00c2\u00a0 Join the conversation in the Metis Telegram, share your use case in the community forum, and follow Metis for iDAO pilot updates and release notes.\u00c2\u00a0Builders can start now by skimming the Hyperion and LazAI docs, then bringing a dataset, model, or agent into the discussion.Related PostTechnology7 Reasons to Build on MetisTechnologyWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinter\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet!Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Unlike the traditional 48-hour format, HyperHack provided time and structure for teams to move from ideation through development, testing, and marketing.The mission was clear:Shine a light on teams turning ideas into reality.Support builders with mentorship and guidance.Improve project quality through community input and feedback.Celebrate innovators who push boundaries and raise the bar.The journey began with more than 130 ideas in the ideation phase. By the final submission deadline, 40 projects had been completed and presented. The momentum continues with the first LazAI Quest, now live on the Hyperion Testnet, where you can test features, make your first transaction, and earn rewards.The Builder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s JourneyParticipants in HyperHack benefited from extensive community and ecosystem support:Fifteen developer workshops and weekly vibe sessions.Testing campaigns that gave real users the chance to try projects and provide feedback.The Spotlight Campaign, which helped builders gain visibility, marketing experience, and an engaged audience.The Spotlight Campaign was a standout feature, designed to give developers practical exposure to marketing and go-to-market strategies. Subsidies for campaigns, templates for outreach, and hands-on support allowed teams to experience what it means to build not only a product, but also a brand.The results spoke for themselves: StreamNFT led the way as the top performer, while Fracture Point, Safe Work Pay, BOLTIS, and LazaiTrader achieved second place recognition. Haithe, Festify, and Eduverse rounded out the third place category, proving that creativity and persistence go hand in hand.Winners of HyperHack 2025Track 1: AI-Native and Core-Aligned ProjectsLazaiTrader \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $25,000Haithe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $25,000Track 2: Real-Time SystemsDogex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $25,000MetaMuse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $25,000Track 3: Infrastructure and Ecosystem ToolsHyperKit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $6,000Hyperion MCP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $6,000Alith Integration TrackEach awarded $5,000: LazaiTrader, GM\u00c2\u00b2 Agent, Score Milk, Tweetrade Bot, Haithe, and MetaMuse.Voices from the CommunityThe winner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement event was not only about recognition; it was about hearing from the builders themselves.Score Milk demonstrated how AI can enrich gaming experiences with its interactive \u00e2\u0080\u009cMilkman\u00e2\u0080\u009d companion.LazaiTrader presented a strategy-driven trading tool that removes emotion from trading and leverages AI for private, data-driven insights.MetaMuse explored the idea of customizable AI companions, showcasing how users could shape agents with their own personalities and data.Dogex introduced the bold vision of high-frequency trading on-chain, a milestone previously considered unrealistic.HyperKit and Hyperion MCP focused on infrastructure, building the critical foundations that enable ecosystems to grow.Their reflections underscored the spirit of HyperHack: collaboration, creativity, and a shared commitment to making Web3 and AI more practical, accessible, and powerful.A Message from the FoundersThe Metis leadership team emphasized that HyperHack was part of a much larger mission.

They hear about its potential but struggle to see how it fits into daily life. Most interactions feel transactional and forgettable. Static NFTs also tend to fade after the first mint. The missing piece has been making these technologies feel personal and alive.Lazbubu bridges that gap by turning AI from a utility into a companion. An interactive, evolving identity that grows through relationships rather than one-off commands. This playful, persistent approach creates the natural onramp that both AI and Web3 have been missing.Metis Portfolio of InnovationsBehind Lazbubu stands the broader mission of the Metis Foundation: building a portfolio of innovations that push the boundaries of cutting edge technology. Metis Andromeda provides the motherchain where builders can create with confidence. ZKM strengthens this foundation with a zkVM that improves verification and compatibility. GOAT connects value by channeling sustainable BTC yield to power activity across networks. LazAI brings it all together by turning these advances toward aligned, user-owned AI agents, with Lazbubu as the first companion to show the mission in practice.What is Lazbubu?Lazbubu is a Companion DAT on LazAI: an onchain AI identity that remembers, adapts, and grows with you. It has a name, a personality, and a face. Your choices and interactions guide how it develops.Each Lazbubu has a rarity tier that can influence growth pace and potential rewards: Common, Advanced, Rare, Legendary.How it WorksMint and name your Lazbubu. You have created a new onchain identity.Chat and choose activities. Talk to your Lazbubu in the LazAI Agent interface and pick what to explore together.Send it on adventures. You can send your Lazbubu on up to 10 adventures per day. Each trip grows your Lazbubu and may also grant you points or other rewards.Grow toward maturity. Consistent, real interaction moves the needle. Repetition without engagement does not.Transfer when mature (optional). Once mature, you can transfer your Lazbubu to another wallet. Its chats, memories, and activity history remain recorded onchain.Postcards and SharingAdventures return with a short story and often a postcard-style image. Sometimes you also receive points. These become a record of your companion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travels and a simple way to track growth over time.LazAI also includes a share flow. You can select moments from your Lazbubu chats and post them publicly or copy a link.\u00c2\u00a0Why This MattersLazbubu blends play, provenance, and ownership. When users own the data that shapes their agents, progress has provenance and value the whole network can recognize.\u00c2\u00a0Your actions write an onchain timeline anyone can verify, so traits and rewards keep their history even after a transfer. As the ecosystem grows, your companion appears in more places and puts that history to work.Where Personal Agents are HeadedWho wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a small, capable AI that travels with them, carries reputation and skills, and plugs into the apps they use? It helps with everyday tasks, adapts to context, and collaborates with other trusted agents when needed. Histories and rewards are portable, so new environments can recognize prior progress.\u00c2\u00a0LazAI is building toward that future, with Lazbubu as the first step. As LazAI introduces missions, tools, and tons more, companions will take on broader roles and create value alongside their communities.\u00c2\u00a0This is only the beginning.Try ItVisit the Explore Zone to earn points and jump in the Kickoff LazAI Quest. You can also follow LazAI on X for feature drops and access waves. By taking part now, minting when you can, sharing stories, and offering feedback, you help shape LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roadmap and what everyday AI agents become.Lazbubu is the first step. AI companions are set to be the next big leap, personal and persistent agents that will change how people connect with AI and with each other.Related PostNo items found.Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Current AI systems optimize for whoever holds the keys.\u00c2\u00a0When corporations control the data and deployment, AI serves shareholder value. When users own their agents and data, the system naturally aligns with community needs. This shift in ownership creates a path toward genuinely human-aligned intelligence.Why Centralized AI Fails CommunitiesToday's AI landscape concentrates power in the hands of a few major corporations. Users generate the data, but companies capture the value. Even well-intentioned AI systems drift toward engagement optimization, data harvesting, and monetization when corporate incentives drive development. A recent Harvard essay echoes this concern about the monopolistic control of AI.Web3 projects often replicate this pattern despite decentralized branding. Many community-labeled AI agents still rely on centralized training, governance, and deployment. Without structural ownership changes, alignment remains superficial. A marketing promise rather than a built-in feature.Ownership Unlocks True AlignmentWhen ownership transfers to users, AI behavior fundamentally changes:Data Resources: Information becomes a private asset rather than corporate propertyUser-Influenced Evolution: Agents adapt based on the users they serve, not distant corporate objectivesValue Circulation: Benefits flow through user-owned networks instead of being extracted by intermediariesDirect Governance: Users set behavioral guardrails and growth parametersPrivacy is becoming a baseline expectation for users. As crypto influencer Gainzy puts it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe future of AI is private\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and onchain rails let communities build toward that reality.Ownership creates the economic foundation for human-alignment. Without it, even the best technical solutions get overruled by profit pressure. Some projects are acutely aware of this and are pioneering the future of decentralized AI. We highlight five examples here.LazAI: Putting Communities in ControlLazAI demonstrates how ownership enables authentic alignment. Agents launch through LazPad and evolve through direct community interaction. Each Companion Data Anchoring Token (DAT) functions as a persistent ownership stake, giving users ongoing influence over agent development.The LazAI Testnet showcases this approach in action. Participants are able to actively shape agent behavior. The result: AI that remembers, adapts, and learns in ways that reflect genuine user values.This model moves beyond traditional prompt-response interactions toward collaborative intelligence development.Hyperion: Infrastructure for Ownership and ScaleScalable user ownership requires infrastructure designed around agents, not just tokens. Hyperion delivers the performance characteristics that user-controlled AI demands:Parallel Execution: Eliminates bottlenecks in agent-user interactionsFast Finality: Enables immediate agent responses without confirmation delaysEthereum Security + EVM Tooling: Build with familiar tools and inherit Ethereum-level security.These capabilities ensure that users get both control and responsiveness, which is a combination traditional systems struggle to provide.Building the Aligned AI FutureUser-owned agents need real throughput and clear governance. Hyperion and LazAI provide both so you can ship faster and keep ownership with your community.Join the conversation in Telegram, post in the Forum, and follow Metis on socials to stay on top of new innovations and ecosystem updates. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled to be building the decentralized AI future together.\u00c2\u00a0Related PostTechnologyMetis EcosystemTechnologyWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinter\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet!Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

But today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built for their scale. If we want agents to evolve, collaborate, and interact meaningfully onchain, we need execution layers that can support them in real time.\u00c2\u00a0Hyperion is that layer.The Problem: Infra That Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Keep Up With AgentsFrankly speaking, most Web3 AI today is still surface-level. A Telegram bot here, a meme agent there, novel for a second or two but ultimately forgettable. Our most impactful Web3 moments are usually driven by culture: timelines, charts, memes, and collective energy. Very few of those moments have involved AI. Not yet.This is not for lack of vision however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a failure of infrastructure.If we want AI agents that can react to real-time markets, coordinate across apps, and grow alongside communities, we need blockchains that can keep up. That means fast execution, flexible coordination, and enough scalability to support swarms of memory-enabled agents acting in parallel. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where Hyperion comes in.Hyperion: Built for Agent-Scale CoordinationHyperion is a high-throughput Layer 2 built with Metis technology. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designed for intelligent applications and persistent agent ecosystems.Three key features make it ideal:Parallel execution: Agents act in parallel instead of waiting in line. This enables real-time coordination and high throughput.Low-latency architecture: Transactions confirm quickly, so agents can respond instantly to market shifts or onchain signals.Native account abstraction: Agents manage smart accounts with programmable permissions. No seed phrases or manual signing required.Together, these features unlock the kind of environment AI agents need: real-time, scalable, and automated from end to end.The Power of ParallelizationIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth going deeper into the most critical feature: parallel execution. Most blockchains process transactions one at a time, like a single-lane road during rush hour. Each car (transaction) waits behind the one in front, crawling forward no matter how urgent the destination.Now imagine that road becomes a freeway with a hundred lanes. Cars move side by side. Throughput skyrockets. Everyone still gets where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what parallel execution enables.Hyperion doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make agents wait. It gives them lanes. Space to move, act, and evolve in real time. Thousands of transactions can run simultaneously. Agents can mint, trade, message, and coordinate logic without clogging the chain. LazAI: Evolving AgentsLazAI shows what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible when agents evolve beyond static bots. It introduces Companion DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens): AI-powered identities that remember, grow, and adapt with their users.These agents are more than collectibles. Lazbubu DATs are launched via Lazpad, then trained, upgraded, and shaped through interaction for personalization, gameplay, and monetization.LazAI is built to interoperate with the Metis ecosystem, including scalable infrastructure like Hyperion. With the LazAI Testnet now live, users can begin exploring the next frontier of intelligent, interactive agents.Scaling Network IntelligenceSo what does this next leap in Web3 actually look like? In a word, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collective. That means:Agent swarms coordinating across apps and protocolsOnchain collaboration that feels fast and seamlessAutonomous actors managing portfolios, communities, and gamesA shared intelligence evolving across networks and usersThis kind of real-time, composable coordination isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possible on chains that process transactions one at a time. It requires a network that can support many agents acting simultaneously, continuously, and without delay.Hyperion unlocks that. It enables a new interaction model where onchain agents form an organism-like interconnectedness.\u00c2\u00a0Closing Thoughts: The Beginning of Agent EconomiesWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only at the beginning of what agents can do onchain. The innovations of Hyperion and LazAI are moving us beyond simple LLM wrappers and Telegram hacks. The former gives agents the speed and scale they need. The latter gives them memory, identity, and purpose. Together, they make possible a new generation of AI-native applications, where intelligence flows across the network as freely as value.Related PostTechnologyFinance is NOT the Future of Blockchain But Cross-Domain Collaboration isTechnologyTECH THURSDAY: SLIPPAGEFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

It leverages the agent-twitter-client library to interact with the Twitter API and uses cron scheduling for periodic execution.Key FeaturesAutomated Tweet Scheduling: Automatically posts tweets at defined intervals.Manual Control Interface: Exposes endpoints for on-demand tweet publishing.Cron Job Management: Provides full API-based control over the cron lifecycle (start, stop, status).Tweet Customization: Tweet content generation logic is modular and easily extendable.Architecture & Folder StructureThe repository is organized into a clean and modular structure:\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 config/ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # Configuration files\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 controller/ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # Core logic for tweet operations\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 routes/ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # API routes\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 services/ \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # Cron job scheduler logic\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 character.json\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # Placeholder for tweet content or persona data\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080 index.js\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # Entry point for the applicationGetting StartedTo get the service running:Install Dependenciesnpm installSetup Environment Variables Create a .env file and configure your Twitter credentials:TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_usernameTWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_passwordTWITTER_EMAIL=your_twitter_emailPORT=3005Start the Applicationnpm start \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # For productionnpm run dev \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 # For developmentAPI EndpointsThe backend provides simple yet effective endpoints:Cron Job ControlGET /api/cron/status \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Check current status of the cron jobPOST /api/cron/start \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manually initiate cron-based tweetingPOST /api/cron/stop \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manually stop the cron jobTweet ControlPOST /api/tweet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manually post a tweetCustomizing Tweet LogicTweet generation logic resides in controller/twitterController.js. Modify the alithfunction() function to change what gets posted:const alithfunction = () => {\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0return \"Your custom tweet content\";};This allows you to integrate dynamic content, fetch real-time data, or generate AI-based responses for richer engagement.Cron Schedule ConfigurationThe default schedule is set to every minute using the cron syntax * * * * *. To adjust the frequency, modify the rule in services/cronService.js. Examples:Every 5 minutes: */5 * * * *Every hour: 0 */1 * * *Daily at 9 AM: 0 9 * * *Monitoring and LoggingThe system logs all events including:Cron service startup and shutdownTweet posting success or failureErrors in Twitter communicationMonitoring can be done through logs or via the /api/cron/status endpoint.TroubleshootingCron Not Running: Use the status endpoint to confirm its state.Twitter Authentication Errors: Recheck credentials in your .env file.Service Stoppage: The cron service restarts automatically on server reboot.ConclusionThe Digital-Twin-Starter-kit offers a foundational backend for anyone interested in social media automation. Its simplicity, combined with extensibility, makes it ideal for developers building AI personas, digital twins, or scheduled social bots. With just a few configuration steps, you can launch a fully operational Twitter automation backend tailored to your unique needs.Explore the full source code on GitHub and youtube::\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Digital-Twin-Starter-kit on GitHub\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Digital-Twin-Starter-kit on YoutubeRelated PostEcosystemMetis Ecosystem Announcement:  Connext Deployment for Cross-Chain SupportTechnologyAlith Framework Contribution Challenge: Empowering Web3 Developers to Shape the Future of Onchain AIFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Builders are moving fast, pushing Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI-optimized, parallel execution layer into action with real, live deployments. From trading platforms to community tools, these dApps show how scalable infrastructure transforms ideas into working products. This recap highlights some of the standout live dApps, with the full list and project details available on the Forum and more being added every day.LazaiTraderLazaiTrader is delivering AI-driven multi-agent trading strategies through a simple Telegram interface. Users choose from specialized AI trading personas, each with unique strategies and risk profiles, to receive buy or sell signals or automate trades. The platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Strategy Vault, built on LazAI and secured in a Trusted Execution Environment, enables private data contribution to a collective knowledge base that improves recommendations for all traders. With features like momentum and volatility-adaptive algorithms, asset-specific personas, and a gamified points system, LazaiTrader brings institutional-grade trading tools and community engagement into a single, accessible experience on Hyperion.\u00e2\u0080\u008dDogexDogex is making perpetual futures trading simple, fast, and beginner-friendly. It offers a clean interface, ultra-low latency, and features like high leverage, 1-minute charts, and an onchain AI assistant for real-time risk analysis and trade suggestions. With a focus on education, community challenges, and a fair token launch, Dogex aims to onboard the next generation of traders into DeFi while showing that perp trading can be both accessible and fully decentralized.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0080\u008dVibesflowVibesflow turns your movements into real-time, AI-generated music. Using motion sensor inputs, the mobile-native app creates continuously adapting soundscapes, with a group mode for parties and events where multiple users can connect to a live stream. It also introduces Real-Time Assets (RTAs), a new revenue model where 60-second audio chunks are co-owned and monetized based on actual plays. With its blend of creative expression, verifiable ownership, and marketplace features, Vibesflow offers a new way to merge motion, music, and blockchain incentives.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0080\u008dHaitheHaithe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decentralized protocol for verifiable AI is focused on closing the \u00e2\u0080\u009csemantic gap\u00e2\u0080\u009d in AI verification. While traditional cryptographic hashes prove a dataset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrity, they say nothing about its origin, quality, or content. Haithe solves this with a decentralized protocol where AI creators submit detailed \u00e2\u0080\u0098Claim Manifests\u00e2\u0080\u0099, domain experts audit those claims through secure, temporary dataset access, and consumers review onchain audit reports before integrating agents. Built on Hyperion and the Alith AI framework, it combines expert-led verification, granular reporting, and incentive alignment to create a transparent trust layer for AI in Web3.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0080\u008dMetaPayMetaPay is a Hyperion Testnet project proposing a sustainable, circulating basic income model powered by digital currency. Instead of relying on higher taxes or government debt, MetaPay distributes an initial fund over ten months, then recollects 10% of each wallet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining balance monthly to fund future cycles. Payments are split automatically between MetaPay and traditional payment methods, with no spending restrictions, creating a fair system where higher-income users contribute more through greater spending. Fully trackable and automated, MetaPay demonstrates how programmable finance on Hyperion can deliver a scalable, transparent basic income without additional government burden.\u00e2\u0080\u008dEduVerseEduVerse is bringing AI-powered, personalized learning onchain. Built on the Alith framework, it combines multi-agent AI tutors, dynamic course and quiz systems, and verifiable onchain credentials. Users sign achievements with their wallet, minting permanent blockchain-stamped diplomas that they fully control. The platform features context-aware TutorChat agents, quiz hint systems, and a polished, interactive UI. With its Learn-to-Earn vision, EduVerse turns education into a transparent, credentialed experience while leveraging Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scalability to make learning both verifiable and engaging.BOLTISBOLTIS is a fun GameFi project delivering the first fully decentralized, real-time multiplayer card battle game with competitive speed and provable fairness.

Some infrastructure exists, but users are left with little to actually interact with. Outside of niche tools, the average person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI agent experience\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Web3 is reduced to Telegram bots or Twitter bots like aixbt.In crypto culture, we see a similar gap. Memecoins and NFTs gather communities around static images or short-term vibes, but they lack systems for ongoing interaction. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no persistent, evolving presence for people to build a relationship with.Metis ecosystem projects LazAI and LazPad address this by introducing Companion DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) that are AI-powered, evolving identities that grow with their users. While Hyperion is building the rails for networks like LazAI to scale.\u00c2\u00a0Filling the Interaction VoidRight now, Web3 AI often feels like infrastructure without a front-end experience. Bots post on Twitter. Slop bots run in Telegram chats. In NFTs and memecoins, interaction often ends after day one and price dips.Evolving AI agents change this. They adapt to their owners, join games, take part in community events, and generate value over time. Pump.fun proved how memetic play fuels community energy. The Metis ecosystem has always moved fast and had fun. We see a future where users grow alongside AI agents. The LazAI Companion DAT (Data Anchoring Token) innovation makes this possible.LazAI Companion DATs: Own, Evolve, and Monetize Your AI AgentLazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Companion DATs are interactive, onchain AI agents with memory, personality, and the ability to evolve. You own them immutably onchain, with every interaction, upgrade, and achievement permanently recorded. They remember past conversations, learn from their owners, and develop unique traits over time. You can chat with them, train them for tasks, bring them into games, and involve them in community activities.\u00c2\u00a0Because DATs are anchored onchain, you can also monetize them, earning from their participation, skills, and the value they create. This transforms AI from a disposable bot into a lasting digital companion you control and profit from.LazPad: Where AI Meets PlayLazPad is more than a launchpad where AI meets onchain play. Built on LazAI and powered by Metis technology, it turns launches into interactive experiences instead of static token drops. Imagine if PumpFun and Virtuals had a baby\u00e2\u0080\u00a6enter LazPad.\u00c2\u00a0Projects can release AI agents, games, and community-driven experiences that users engage with from day one. LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agent infrastructure and Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scalable execution combine to make every launch a space for interaction, growth, and shared value. Read the LazPad Manifesto here. LazPad is the entry point for bringing playful, evolving AI into the hands of the community. However, AI agents push onchain scalability to its limits, demanding massive throughput and low latency. Hyperion is purpose-built to meet those demands.Hyperion as the Scalable AI LayerHyperion is the Metis network optimised for AI. Its parallelized architecture processes many transactions at once, enabling fast, responsive AI-driven experiences.LazAI builds on Hyperion to keep Companion DAT interactions fluid, even with thousands of users online. The result is a stable environment where evolving AI agents can operate in real time without lag.Summary: From Corporate to CreativeThe old industry model of corporate products is fading, especially in crypto and new tech. The future is meme-rich, interactive, and, for lack of a better word, silly. Onchain AI identities are becoming living entities that you can collaborate with, not just look at.We are just at the tip of the iceberg. The next evolution of Web3 AI goes beyond Telegram and Twitter bots to interactive AI agents you can engage with, grow, and own. The Metis ecosystem is building this future, turning AI into something you play with, evolve, and earn from. Powered by Metis Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scalable AI infrastructure, LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI network, and Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 battle-tested toolkit, we are making AI part of your daily digital life, aligned to improve human lives.\u00e2\u0080\u008dRelated PostNo items found.Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

In this blog, we walk through how to build and deploy a TEE-enabled application using the Alith framework and Phala Network, leveraging Phala Cloud for production-grade deployment.This guide is based on our recent workshop where we demonstrated the step-by-step deployment of a secure, fastAPI-based TE service.What Is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)?A TEE is a secure area of a CPU that guarantees the code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Even privileged software such as the operating system or hypervisor cannot tamper with the code or data inside the TEE.Use cases include:Secure key managementPrivate smart contractsConfidential machine learningRemote attestation and proof generationWhy Use Alith for TEEs?Alith natively supports TEE operations including:Key derivation: Generate and manage cryptographic keys securely.Remote attestation: Generate cryptographic proofs (e.g., Intel TDX quote).Support for multiple TEE backends: Including Marlin (local testing) and Phala (production deployment).For quick iteration, developers can start with the Marlin simulator locally. But for real-world, cloud-based, confidential compute needs, Phala Network is the recommended provider.Running TEE with Phala CloudPrerequisitesDocker installed and runningA Phala Cloud account (provides $400 in free credits upon adding a payment method)Python 3.12+Alith and fastapi packagesGitHub repo: Workshop Example RepoChoosing Your TEE Provider: Why Phala (and What Else You Can Use)In our workshop, we chose Phala Network as the default TEE provider. Phala is a Web3-native project that supports trusted hardware, makes deployment straightforward via Phala Cloud, and even offers $400 in free credits upon adding a payment method (which covers most basic usage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with ~$30/month beyond that).However, Phala is not mandatory. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free to choose alternative TEE backends, such as GCP or your own infrastructure, as long as they support the required TEE features and remote attestation.In fact, we encourage teams to consider:Running their own TEE infrastructure (similar to managing their own RPC nodes)Deploying our reference implementation directlyCustomizing the business logic or setup to suit their use case\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a1 Important: If your usage exceeds the Phala free tier, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to cover the extra cost. Be sure to monitor this and evaluate whether your current architecture might be over-engineered for early testing.That said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember: LazAI is still in the testnet phase, and the current Phala free tier is generally sufficient for most basic usage scenarios. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hitting usage limits early, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth reviewing whether your current architecture is over-engineered for this stage.The TEE layer is critical to the LazAI network as it ensures data trust and verifiability. Clear communication of cost and flexibility is essential for builders working with this setup.Step-by-Step Walkthrough1.

Developers are increasingly working with sensitive data, including healthcare records, financial transactions, and personal documents, where data leakage is not an option.LazAI offers a practical solution for secure data inference using LLMs, powered by confidential computing and onchain accountability. This guide introduces the LazAI-API-Starter-kit, a Python-based project that allows users to perform private data inference through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and the Alith SDK.This blog summarizes the hands-on experience shared during a recent live workshop, including installation, setup, and a walkthrough of the inference process.Why Privacy Matters in LLM ApplicationsWhile LLMs like GPT-4 can provide value in analyzing and summarizing data, they also pose privacy risks when fed sensitive input. Standard inference methods often upload user data to third-party servers where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stored, logged, or reused.LazAI avoids these issues by combining:Confidential AI computation through TEEsOn-chain tracking of data access via File IDsReward mechanisms for data contributors through Data Anchoring Tokens (DATs)What Is LazAI?LazAI enables developers to run inference on private data without compromising user privacy. The process supports:Secure data contributionTEE-backed inference server executionPrivacy-preserving request/response cycles with LLMsAll actions are verifiable and optionally reward data contributors when their files are used.Project OverviewThe LazAI-API-Starter-kit is a Python demo that enables users to:Connect to a registered LazAI inference serverLoad and query a private file using an LLMReceive inference results without exposing the raw dataProject StructureQuickstart GuidePrerequisitesPython 3.8 or higherLazAI-compatible private keyAn accessible inference server (local or hosted in TEE)Setup InstructionsClone the repository and create a virtual environment:Setting Environment VariablesExport your private key (replace with your own):export PRIVATE_KEY=<your-wallet-private-key>Optional for OpenRouter or OpenAI-compatible models:export LLM_API_KEY=<openrouter-or-openai-key>export LLM_BASE_URL=<base-url-if-not-openai>Running the Inference ScriptExecute the script:python inference.pyThe script:Checks if the user is registered and has made a depositRetrieves the appropriate inference server URLSends a prompt to the LLM using a file IDDisplays the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response without revealing the file contentsArchitecture OverviewEach inference flow consists of three components:Data Contribution Users contribute data through a signed transaction. A File ID is generated, and a Data Anchoring Token (DAT) is issued.Inference Server (TEE) A secure enclave (e.g. via Phala) handles encrypted model execution. Servers must be registered by an admin before they are discoverable.Inference Request Using the Alith SDK, users send a prompt tied to a File ID. The response is returned after secure evaluation.\u00e2\u0080\u008dUse CasesThis architecture enables applications such as:Tax report generation from private bank statementsSummarization of encrypted patient recordsPrivate AI agents with persistent memorySecure enterprise document assistantsBenefits of LazAI ArchitectureConfidentiality: The inference server uses TEEs, ensuring input data is never exposed.Verifiability: On-chain metadata provides audit trails and usage tracking.Incentivization: Data contributors earn rewards (DATs) when their files are used.Modularity: Supports Python, Node.js, and (soon) Rust SDKs.Future DirectionsThe LazAI ecosystem will soon support:Open community access to register inference nodesGUI-based data contribution and reward trackingExpanded model compatibility (LLM endpoints, local models)Integration with Web3 identity and reputation systemsResourcesLazAI-API-Starter-kit GitHubConclusionThe LazAI-API-Starter-kit provides a developer-ready approach to building AI-powered apps with full data privacy. By combining LLMs with secure inference, TEEs, and on-chain rewards, developers can deliver functionality without compromising trust.Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re handling health records, financial data, or personalized AI agents, this kit offers a strong foundation for privacy-first applications in Web3.Related PostNo items found.Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Web3 token voting can enable meritocratic decentralized governance, but so far in practice, it often ends with a handful of whales pushing through their own proposals while the broader community checks out in silence.At Metis and Hyperion, we design governance around participation, not solely token accumulation. Every proposal, update, and milestone is rooted in dialogue. The Forum is the first block in the chain of decision-making.Debate Then DecideGovernance begins with questions. The Hyperion Forum gives every community member space to share, challenge, and refine ideas. Whether you're a developer or a designer, a first-timer or a long-time contributor, your input matters before any vote is cast.This model helps decisions mature before they go live. It also opens space for contributors to shape grant allocations, suggest upgrades, and incubate ideas long before they reach the ballot.People Before ProtocolPeople govern better when they talk. Not just in snapshots or votes, but in real back-and-forth. Metis embraces that rhythm. Disagreement is not a failure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a feature. Good decisions are shaped by thoughtful friction, cheeky memes, and clear understanding.We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want quick reactions. We want shared outcomes.Builders at the CenterMost protocols reward passive capital. Metis rewards active contribution. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why our governance structure centers around Guilds with organized groups of builders, operators, and marketers who move the ecosystem forward every day.Your path to impact isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gated by how much you hold. It opens when you start building.Guilds Are Power ToolsGuilds give our community more than just a seat at the table. They offer tools to shape the table itself. Each Guild has clear roles, aligned incentives, and real responsibilities. From shaping upgrade proposals to hiring collaborators and surfacing user feedback, Guilds act as the connective tissue of a working ecosystem.Congrats to our new community Guild Leaders Han, Aryanztshi and Supaman who will drive the Forum Marketers, Operators and Builders Guilds forward.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bThe Future is OpenVotes still count. But they follow conversation, not replace it. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to help shape Metis, Hyperion, and the AI-native economy being built on LazAI, now is the time to speak up.Join a Guild.

It would not scale.Enter Hyperion. Built with parallel execution and AI-native infrastructure, Hyperion is the Layer 2 where intelligent agents can operate, evolve, and collaborate at scale. This article explores how Metis Hyperion is building the groundwork for a new onchain economy of networked intelligence.Why AI Agents Need Scalable InfraThe rise of AI agents brings new demands on blockchain infrastructure. These agents are constantly learning, adapting, and making decisions in real time. That requires:High throughput for autonomous decisions: Each AI agent could initiate hundreds of micro-transactions, negotiations, or contract executions per day.Low latency: Agents can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to wait for block confirmations when acting in fast-paced environments like prediction markets or gaming ecosystems.Native support for agent communication: As they collaborate, agents need a shared environment with predictable performance and composable protocols.Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s architecture is designed to meet these exact needs. Hyperion can handle thousands of AI-driven actions simultaneously. No queues. Real-time execution across agent DAOs, games, data markets, and more.Parallel ExecutionMost blockchains process transactions one by one, which slows down AI agents and real-time apps that rely on fast onchain actions. Hyperion solves this with parallel execution, boosting throughput by running many transactions at once and only resolving conflicts when needed.No more bottlenecks or gas wars. Just fast, conflict-aware execution. Chains like Sei Network and Monad are already building parallel execution environments as it rapidly becomes the new gold standard for Web3 scalability. Learn exactly how Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parallelization works here.\u00c2\u00a0AI Use Cases Are Already Coming to LifeProtocols are actively being built on the Hyperion Testnet right now through the $200,000 HyperHack competition. These projects are turning theory into practice with real-world applications that stretch across gaming, data, infrastructure, and governance.Imagination is the only limitation for what can be built. Some exciting agent-native use cases include:Games that host thousands of evolving NPC agents with real assets and player interactionDAOs delegating treasury management to autonomous agent swarms that react to market conditionsLazPad launchpad where users raise, evolve, and monetize AI companions directly onchainData markets powered by Outpost agents that tag, verify, and trade datasets for training or inferenceDePIN logistics coordinated by AI agents managing routes, pricing, and uptime for decentralized devicesDevelopers can use Hyperion as a coordination layer for intelligent systems that can observe, learn, and take action verifiably and transparently.SummaryAI agents are here. The next step is giving them a home that speaks their language and scales with their minds.Hyperion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just built for speed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a foundation for decentralized intelligence, where autonomous agents connect, learn, and create value in ways that remain aligned with human intent and governed by communities.Follow Metis on socials to stay ahead of the AI frontier.

Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protecting user data, safeguarding AI prompts, or securing enterprise-sensitive computations, developers need tools that offer both privacy and verifiability.In this guide, we explore a hands-on project built in Python that showcases secure data handling using three critical components:Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for secure computeMarlin Attestation for proof of computation integrityIPFS for decentralized, verifiable storageThe result: a fully auditable, secure data flow that combines the strength of Web3 storage with trusted hardware guarantees. if you prefer video format, watch the YouTube recording of the live workshop. Why Trust Matters in Web3 ComputeDecentralization has solved many problems, but not all. When it comes to handling sensitive data or executing confidential code, decentralized networks alone fall short. Users must trust that the computation was done correctly and privately. This is where TEEs and attestation play a crucial role.What is a TEE?A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a device\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processor that ensures both confidentiality and integrity of code and data. Even privileged software like operating systems and hypervisors cannot access what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening inside the enclave.What is Marlin?Marlin provides lightweight remote attestation services. It can prove that a given computation was executed in a TEE without being tampered with. Marlin is integrated with the Alith SDK, offering an easy interface for:TEE key managementAttestation proof (quote) generationSecure integration with dAppsCombined with IPFS, this stack allows you to publicly share and verify sensitive data with full cryptographic assurance.Project OverviewThis Python-based demo illustrates how to:Load and encrypt sensitive dataGenerate an attestation proof via MarlinUpload both data and proof to IPFSPublicly verify the data and computation integrityProject StructureFilePurposeapp.pyMain script to attest and store dataQuickstart GuidePrerequisitesPython 3.8+IPFS daemon running locally (go-ipfs)Marlin attestation server (simulator or production node)Internet access to test via IPFS gatewaysSetup InstructionsClone the project and install dependencies:git clone https://github.com/metis-edu/Tee_Marlin_IPFS.gitcd Tee_Marlin_IPFSpython3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install alith requestsLaunching Marlin (Simulator)Run the attestation service locally:docker run --init -p 127.0.0.1:1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mockAlternatively, build from source:git clone https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepocd oyster-monorepo/attestation/server-custom-mockcargo run -rRunning the DemoRun the main script:python3 app.pySample OutputSecure data stored on IPFS: bafybeie...xyzTEE proved it, IPFS stored it, anyone can verify itView it at: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>The script:Loads a sensitive message from a fileSends it to a simulated Marlin TEE for attestationUploads both the message and attestation proof to IPFSReturns the IPFS CID (Content Identifier)Architecture OverviewEach step ensures that the data:Was processed securelyIs provably tamper-freeCan be verified by anyone without requiring trust in the data providerExample OutputIPFS Payload{\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\"data\": \"Secret: Alice pays Bob $100\",\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\"proof\": \"8444a1013822a0590782a969d6f64756c655f69647827692d\"}Visual SnapshotsIPFS Upload SuccessAttested Data FormatBenefits of This StackConfidentiality: TEEs ensure data cannot be snooped or altered.Integrity: Marlin proves the computation was legitimate and untampered.Decentralization: IPFS ensures no centralized storage dependency.Transparency: Verifiable proofs allow trustless sharing and auditing.Future Use CasesOnchain AI inferencing with secure pre-processingPrivacy-preserving medical or financial data workflowsDAO-governed confidential task offloadingPublic verification of private computations in ZK systemsResources & RepositoriesAlith SDK\u00c2\u00a0Marlin ProtocolIPFS DocumentationPhala NetworkProject GitHubConclusionCombining TEEs with attestation and decentralized storage gives developers a powerful toolkit for building privacy-first Web3 applications.

In a recent interview, Metis Co-Founder Elena Sinelnikova emphasized that anyone building AI tools in Web3 is on the same team, because the mission is shared. All of Web3 should unite to ensure AI works for humanity, not against it. These platforms are not just enabling AI, they are rebuilding how data, compute, and incentives flow across intelligent agents and decentralized networks. At Metis, where scaling and composability drive our vision, we are proud to support the builders at the forefront of this evolution. Here are five standout AI infrastructure projects redefining what is possible in Web3.1. Bittensor: A Marketplace for Machine IntelligenceBittensor is a decentralized network that rewards participants for contributing to a global AI model. It utilizes an incentive structure with similar mechanisms to Bitcoin. Unlike traditional closed AI systems, Bittensor builds an open economy where machine learning nodes compete and collaborate, improving a shared intelligence layer.Bittensor's approach turns compute into a tradeable commodity and gives contributors ownership over the AI services they help build. It is one of the most mature examples of tokenized AI compute coordination in the space.\u00e2\u0080\u008d2. Gensyn: Decentralized Compute for AIGensyn is building a decentralized network for machine learning training that is deeply aligned with Ethereum's principles. The protocol uses Ethereum mainnet as its settlement layer, ensuring transparency and immutability in how training jobs and proofs are managed.Its incentive system is fully Ethereum-native, with rewards and validation coordinated through smart contracts. Gensyn also embraces open validator participation, allowing anyone to contribute compute and earn for verified output.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008d3. Virtuals: AI Agent LaunchpadVirtuals created waves in the crypto markets last year with its \u00e2\u0080\u0098Society of Agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099. But there was real signal within the noise. Born on Base and recently expanded to Solana, Users have launched thousands of onchain agents capable of interacting socially, via Virtuals. Including the notable AIXBT, which claims an impressive share of Crypto Twitter mindshare.\u00c2\u00a0This transparent and fair access model inspired LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch of LazPad, which combines the best of Virtuals' agent launchpad mechanics with the playful, viral appeal of PumpFun.\u00e2\u0080\u008d4. LazAI: Where AI Becomes an AssetLazAI is building the foundation for an internal AI economy powered by onchain incentives, verifiable compute, and composable intelligence. At the heart of LazAI is the Data Anchoring Token (DAT), which transforms AI agents into interactive digital assets. These agents grow through user interaction, and their memory and logic can be transferred, shared, and monetized.LazAI also recently introduced LazPad, the platform's \u00e2\u0080\u0098Play First\u00e2\u0080\u0099 launch environment for experimental AI agents that evolve over time. From AI-native tools to data-sharing protocols, LazAI is showcasing a full-stack vision where developers, users, and agents co-create value. Join the LazAI Pre-Testnet to be an early adopter.\u00c2\u00a05. Hyperion: The AI Chain Built to ScaleHyperion is a Layer 2 chain purpose built for AI utilizing Metis tooling. With native parallel execution and high throughput architecture, Hyperion is optimized to support swarms of AI agents interacting, reasoning, and transacting onchain in real time.As AI models scale and demand faster feedback loops, Hyperion provides the performance backbone without sacrificing decentralization. It is where verifiable inference, real time AI gaming, and low latency marketplaces are starting to take shape. For AI developers who need blockchain speed that matches agent reactivity, Hyperion is the chain to watch.\u00e2\u0080\u008dFinal ThoughtsAI and blockchain are no longer separate tracks. The most exciting frontier today is where they converge, where agents own data, compute earns yield, and intelligence becomes composable. At Metis, we are proud to support and collaborate with projects pushing these boundaries.Whether you are building on Hyperion, minting your first DAT on LazPad, or exploring incentive design with Bittensor, now is the time to experiment. The infrastructure is ready. The future of intelligent, decentralized systems is being built today.\u00e2\u0080\u008dRelated PostCommunityimToken Wallet integrates MetisTechnologyMETIS PROLOGUE USER GUIDEFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

In our recent live workshop, Pavel and Thiru from the LazAI team presented a deep dive into building onchain AI agents using the LazAI frameworks, focusing on data contribution, job orchestration, and secure inference execution. This blog post summarizes the core concepts, workflows, and tools covered during the session.The Need for Verifiable AITraditional AI systems are often opaque. As users, we rarely know if the model used the right data, whether the inference process was tampered with, or if results can be trusted, especially in high-stakes financial operations. LazAI addresses this trust gap by creating a verifiable AI marketplace that cryptographically registers data, distributes jobs, and confirms results through a decentralized settlement layer.Components of the LazAI SystemAgents represent the drivers of AI tasks, executing on top of foundational LLMs.Data acts as the navigational input for these agents.LLMs (Large Language Models) are the infrastructure powering AI reasoning.LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to create a full-stack solution where data submission, processing, and outcome validation all happen onchain.The Architecture: Alith, LazAI Client, and HyperionAt the heart of this architecture lies Alith, a client-side framework for building AI agents. Underpinning Alith is the LazAI Client, which handles all onchain interactions, including job execution and settlement, on the Hyperion blockchain.Key Functions:Data Registration: Allows users to register training or inference data via an IPFS hash.Proof Submission: Verifies that submitted data is valid and accessible.Inference Execution: Jobs are sent to nodes, which execute the request and post results onchain.Tokenized Rewards: Contributors are compensated with DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens), ERC-1155 NFTs that represent data ownership and future royalties.Workflow OverviewThe lifecycle of a typical onchain AI task includes:Data Contribution:Encrypt and upload data.Register the data hash onchain via the LazAI client.Submit the data to IPFS (e.g., via Pinata).A job is created for data verification by nodes.Upon successful verification, a DAT is minted to the contributor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet.Job Execution and Inference:A user deposits funds to a node for inference.The user sends a request to a node using a defined model and prompt.The node processes the request and submits proof of work.The smart contract verifies completion and distributes the reward.Settlement and Governance:Settlement contracts ensure fair payments to node operators.IDOWs (Independent DAOs) manage data registries and act as governing entities.Proxy contracts ensure upgradability without compromising existing registries.Code ExamplesThe session featured multiple examples, particularly using Python and Node.js. A few highlights:Registering Dataconst file = await client.addFile(\"encrypted_file.json\");const proofRequest = await client.requestProof(file.fileId);\u00e2\u0080\u008dRunning Inferenceconst inferenceUrl = await client.getNodeUrl(nodeAddress);const result = await axios.post(`${inferenceUrl}/v1/infer`, {\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0fileId: \"74\",\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0prompt: \"Translate to French\"});Verifying Data onchainThe smart contract stores the file hash and verifies existence through proofs generated by nodes.Each contract (Data Registry, AI Process, Settlement) has specific functions to ensure modularity and traceability.Tooling and Developer SupportLazAI offers SDKs in:PythonNode.js(Rust examples are in progress.)The team maintains open repositories on GitHub under the 0xLazAI organization. Developers can access documentation, boilerplate code, and examples for integrating with the network.HyperHack BountyAs part of the HyperHack, participants are encouraged to build architectural diagrams and implementations using the LazAI system. The focus should be on conceptual integration rather than complete technical deployment. Projects can include:Building inference agents that consume onchain data.Designing DAO-based governance for data verification.Creating job queues for specialized AI tasks.Final ThoughtsThe LazAI framework represents a step forward in making AI computation trustless, decentralized, and fairly incentivized. By leveraging cryptographic proofs, tokenized data ownership, and modular smart contracts, developers can now build AI agents that are not only powerful but also transparent and verifiable.Watch the Full Workshop:Onchain AI Inferencing Workshop on YouTube\u00e2\u0080\u008dRelated PostNo items found.Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

No more bottlenecks, no more gas wars. Just fast, conflict-free execution. Chains like Sei Network\u00c2\u00a0and Monad are pioneering parallel execution. Hyperion, built using Metis technology, joins this frontier as a high-throughput Layer 2 designed specifically for intelligent, scalable applications. This article explains how it works.\u00e2\u0080\u008dWhy Parallel Execution Matters \u00e2\u0080\u008dMost blockchains today still process transactions one at a time. This ensures correctness but limits throughput and responsiveness, especially during periods of high activity. Many AI agents and dApps try to minimize onchain activity, but when quick onchain reads and writes are needed, such as in games, real-time decisions or social apps, slow transactions cause real problems.Hyperion introduces parallel execution, allowing many transactions to run simultaneously. It assumes no conflicts will occur and resolves only those that do. This dramatically increases transaction capacity while maintaining correctness.Core Mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u008dHyperion uses optimistic execution to speed up processing. Each transaction runs in parallel, assuming that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conflict with others. This process follows 3 general steps:\u00e2\u0080\u008d1. Multiple transactions execute at the same time using available CPU cores.2. A multi-version memory system (MVMemory) tracks all versions of the state data as transactions are executed.3. Each transaction log is a read and write set, detailing exactly what parts of the state it interacted with.This approach enables high throughput without compromising safety.\u00e2\u0080\u008dConflict Detection and Resolution\u00e2\u0080\u008dOnce all transactions have executed optimistically, the system checks for conflicts. It looks at each transaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read set to see if any earlier transaction modified that data.If a conflict is found, meaning a transaction reads stale data, it is re-executed with the updated state. This ensures that all dependencies are resolved correctly.The process repeats until all transactions are complete without conflict. The end result is a block of transactions that could have been processed sequentially but were instead executed in a fraction of the time.\u00e2\u0080\u008dKey Components\u00e2\u0080\u008dThree main systems coordinate Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parallel execution:Scheduler assigns transactions to worker threads and manages re-execution when needed.MVMemory maintains all state versions, helping isolate transactional effects and resolve the data each transaction should read.VmDB connects the EVM to MVMemory, intercepting reads and writes while tracking dependencies.These components ensure high-speed execution while preserving determinism and network safety.\u00e2\u0080\u008dOptimizations \u00e2\u0080\u008dHyperion improves efficiency through a set of low-level execution enhancements. It uses deferred updates for common operations like gas payments and ETH transfers, reducing unnecessary dependencies. Lock-free data structures keep CPU threads running smoothly without blocking, while pre-execution dependency graphs help predict conflicts before they occur. Transactions are also scheduled strategically to minimize overlap and re-execution. These combined optimizations increase throughput without adding complexity to the system.\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeterministic Guarantee\u00e2\u0080\u008dEven with transactions executing in parallel, Hyperion ensures a deterministic final state. The output of any block is guaranteed to match what would result from sequential execution, by respecting the original transaction order during conflict resolution.This makes Hyperion compatible with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements and ensures consistency across all network participants.Explore the technical details of Hyperion's parallel execution architecture in the Docs.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0080\u008dBuilt for AI-Optimized Scalability\u00e2\u0080\u008dHyperion is part of a broader trend in high-performance blockchain design but stands apart in its focus on AI scalability. Onchain AI agents benefit from low-latency environments, concurrent interactions, and high-throughput pipelines. For example, an AI trading agent on a DEX would need to read onchain prices, slippage and gas fees in real time. If this is processed too slowly the trade could fail or miss best price execution. Hyperion provides the infrastructure to support high throughput demands, making it a launchpad for real-time, intelligent applications that can scale.\u00e2\u0080\u008dSummary\u00e2\u0080\u008dWhere Metis Andromeda focuses on production-grade deployments, Hyperion explores the outer limits of scalability and tests innovations like parallel transaction execution that are critical to supporting decentralized AI.The Hyperion Testnet is live and open to all developers. Teams are already launching agent marketplaces, AI-driven dApps, and real-time coordination tools using its infrastructure. Hyperion is more than just an L2. It is the infrastructure layer for scalable, AI-native blockchain ecosystems.If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building the future, build it here.Related PostTechnologyMetis Liquid Staking Blitz (LSB)EcosystemHashkey Cloud Live on Metis Mainnet, Becomes Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 First External Decentralized Sequencer ClientFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

In this article, we will walk through building a conversational AI agent that interfaces with smart contracts on the Metis Hyperion Testnet. This project integrates memory, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Web3 functionality using the Alith framework.This agent not only queries ERC20 token balances and metadata but also remembers past user interactions and retrieves contextual knowledge from a local store. By leveraging the Alith framework alongside Web3.py and vector databases, developers can create intelligent agents with both domain knowledge and transactional capabilities.Overview of FeaturesThis Onchain AI Agent includes the following capabilities:ERC20 Token Balance Checker: Fetches balance and metadata for any ERC20 token on Metis Hyperion.Memory-Enabled Conversations: Maintains a persistent memory of previous user inputs for contextual responses.Knowledge Base via RAG: Retrieves information from a local knowledge repository, including details about Metis, token standards, and best practices.Alith Integration: Connects a natural language interface to blockchain agents via OpenAI-compatible models.Getting StartedTo begin, clone the repository and set up your Python environment:git clone https://github.com/metis-edu/Onchain-Agent-RAG-with-Memory.gitcd Onchain-Agent-RAG-with-Memorypython -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate\u00c2\u00a0 # On Windows, use: venv\\Scripts\\activatepip install alith web3 python-dotenv torchFor vector-based semantic search functionality, install the following:pip install \"pymilvus[model]\"Environment ConfigurationCreate a .env file in the root directory and include your OpenAI API key:API_KEY=your_openai_api_keyThis key is required for the Alith agent to access language model capabilities.Running the AgentStart the agent with:python demo.pyThe interface supports command-line input. For example, to check the balance of a token for a specific wallet, use:check <token_contract_address> <wallet_address>Example OutputToken Balance ReportToken Name: ExampleTokenSymbol: EXTTotal Supply: 1,000,000.00 EXTDecimals: 18Wallet: 0x412dA7...F5063Balance: 250.00 EXTRaw Balance: 250000000000000000000\u00e2\u0080\u008dSystem ArchitectureThe agent combines several components:Web3.py: Interfaces with the Ethereum-compatible Metis Hyperion network for smart contract interactions.Alith.Agent: Handles conversational logic, memory persistence, and prompt orchestration.dotenv: Loads environment variables securely.MilvusStore (optional): Acts as a vector database for retrieval-augmented generation from a local markdown knowledge base.metis_knowledge.md: Contains domain-specific information on Metis, tokens, and best practices.Use CasesThis agent is suitable for developers and power users who require:Real-time token balance verificationContext-aware blockchain queriesAI-powered assistance for smart contract interactionAutomated Telegram bot deploymentsThe included tg-bot.py script demonstrates how the agent can be deployed as a Telegram bot to facilitate:Token deployment (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)Natural language queries about balances and metadataSimplified user interaction for onchain operationsTroubleshootingIssueSolutionMissing API key errorEnsure .env is present and API_KEY is definedNo token data returnedVerify the contract address is valid and deployed on Metis SepoliaRAG not workingEnsure Milvus is installed and properly configuredAgent unresponsiveCheck Metis Sepolia RPC endpoint and network connectivityResourcesMetis Hyperion Explorer\u00c2\u00a0OpenAI API DocumentationAlith Framework Repository\u00c2\u00a0Python Telegram Bot DocumentationConclusionThe integration of AI with blockchain offers powerful possibilities for creating intelligent agents that are both conversational and transactional.

The goal of the session was to demonstrate how developers can interact with this DEX, build AI-driven trading agents, and leverage Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time architecture for intelligent DeFi workflows.This blog recaps the workshop, outlines the tools available, and explains how to integrate AI agents into trading applications on Hyperion.Purpose of the Hyperion Testnet DEXThe Hyperion Testnet DEX is designed to provide developers with a single unified environment for trading-related activity within the Hyperhack. Built to simulate production-like interactions, it allows participants to explore how their agents and tools can operate in real time.Key goals of the DEX include:Testing automated trading workflowsExperimenting with subgraph-based indexingIntegrating AI-driven bots using standard protocolsYou can find documentation and developer resources at Hyperion Doc.Getting Started with the DEXThe DEX is accessible at Test DEX. Upon accessing the interface, users can interact with familiar DeFi functions including:Token swapsLiquidity provision and withdrawalPool monitoringSupported token pairs currently include:METIS / USDTUSDT / WETHDAI / METISWBTC / USDTAlthough this is a testnet deployment, it mirrors Uniswap V2 mechanics, offering developers a realistic testing environment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that the absence of trading bots means price fluctuations can persist longer than in live markets, making it ideal for simulating arbitrage or strategy-driven trading scenarios.If you need test tokens to begin interacting with the DEX, you can request them via the Hyperhack Forum.Subgraph AccessTo enable data-driven applications, the DEX is backed by a GraphQL subgraph that indexes:All swap eventsLiquidity actionsToken pair configurationsFactory-level statsSubgraph URL:This subgraph allows developers and AI agents to perform granular queries, such as:Historical swaps for a token pairReal-time tracking of transaction volumePool liquidity snapshotsThis infrastructure enables deeper integration with AI agents that need to reason over market state or build predictive models.The MCP Server: A REST Interface for Agent IntegrationTo streamline agent development, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve deployed an MCP (Meta Control Protocol) server. The MCP server acts as a lightweight RESTful wrapper over the subgraph, abstracting common queries into accessible API endpoints.Functionality includes:Fetching token and pair metadataRetrieving liquidity pool informationAccessing recent swap activityQuerying factory statsThe MCP was purpose-built to simplify integration with external services, including AI toolkits and automation platforms. It is particularly effective for use with AI agents developed using the Alith SDK or similar frameworks.AI Agent Architecture Using Hyperion DEXDuring the session, we outlined how to integrate Hyperion DEX into an AI agent workflow. The architecture includes:Tool Agent Fetches data from the MCP server (e.g., top pools by liquidity or volume).Analysis Agent Performs logic or technical analysis on the tool agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to identify trading signals.Execution Agent Executes trades based on predefined strategies or outputs from the analysis phase.The result is a modular and composable AI-driven trading system capable of making autonomous decisions based on real-time DEX data.We showcased an example involving Alith agents, where:The tool agent queries the top pools.The MCP server provides this data via API.The analysis agent evaluates transaction counts and pool activity.Strategic insights are generated for trading bots or dashboards.How to Think About Onchain AIA question was raised during the session regarding how AI is integrated into the Hyperion ecosystem.While full model inference onchain remains limited by current infrastructure, Hyperion allows for AI-native architectural design, where reasoning and decision-making workflows leverage onchain data and logic.For the purposes of the Hyperhack:We are more interested in why and how AI agents should operate onchain.Participants should focus on designing architectures that justify onchain components over purely offchain approaches.Developers can combine subgraph data, AI logic, and smart contracts to demonstrate value in a decentralized, verifiable setting.AI inferencing can be done offchain while referencing onchain data indexed by the subgraph or fetched through the MCP server. This hybrid approach allows for powerful AI use cases without compromising scalability or cost.Hyperhack Ideathon: Final Days to JoinThe Hyperhack Ideathon is open until June 15, 2025. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still time to apply if you are working on an idea or want to build on Hyperion.Tracks include:AI-Native: AI workflows integrated directly into onchain systemsReal-Time: Applications that benefit from Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low-latency, parallel executionInfrastructure & Tools: Solutions that simplify onboarding, tooling, or developer UXParticipants are encouraged to submit projects that demonstrate:Clear reasoning for building on HyperionWell-architected onchain/offchain designPractical application of real-time or AI featuresConclusionThe Hyperion Testnet DEX and supporting infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the subgraph and MCP server\u00e2\u0080\u0094provide a robust foundation for building and testing AI-powered DeFi agents. By using these tools, developers can explore cutting-edge use cases such as autonomous trading, liquidity automation, and intelligent analysis on a performant Layer 2 network.We look forward to seeing the innovations that emerge from the Hyperhack and invite all developers to participate, ask questions, and build the future of decentralized intelligence.Related PostCommunityDecentralized Sequencer Upgrade: Phase 2TechnologyThe Tech Journey: Lower Gas Costs & Storage Layer on MetisFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Decentralized machine learning marks a shift from centralized AI monopolies toward systems where individuals and communities can control the data, models, and incentives behind intelligent agents. Hyperion, the AI optimized Layer 2 developed by Metis, is built to support this shift. It offers a high performance foundation for running AI models onchain, where outcomes can be verified, coordinated, and owned by users themselves.A Vision of AI for the People\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0080\u009cCentralized companies that own AI data, own us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Natalia Ameline, Decentralization Coordinator at Metis, during her recent interview with \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll In Crypto\u00e2\u0080\u009d at Consensus 2025.For Natalia, Hyperion is not just a technical upgrade. It is a response to a deeper problem: centralized control over intelligence itself. She describes Hyperion as infrastructure for a new kind of internet where users govern the intelligence they interact with. That means giving individuals the tools to shape the systems that shape them.The ethos of \"Decentralization Maximalism\" reflects Natalia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision and the original spirit of crypto. It champions open systems, user sovereignty, and public infrastructure over third-party platform control.Executing this vision includes not only deploying autonomous agents but anchoring their logic and decisions to transparent, verifiable data onchain, giving society the means to challenge, override, or improve intelligent systems rather than simply accept them.Composable AI Across Metis Networks\u00e2\u0080\u008dThe MetisSDK is a high performance framework for building AI native blockchains. It supports Solidity, Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pectra upgrade, and flexible deployments. Developers can use it to launch scalable networks for onchain LLM inference, model training, and AI compute resource sharing. This SDK powers the entire Metis ecosystem, including infrastructure like MetisVM, MetisDB, and the Real Time Sequencer.Projects like Hyperion and LazAI are built on this foundation. Hyperion delivers sub second finality, AI ready contracts, and high throughput using parallel execution. LazAI adds a decentralized inference layer through the Alith agent framework, enabling verifiable and composable AI outputs. Together, they demonstrate how the MetisSDK can unlock real time, onchain artificial intelligence.Intelligence at the Execution Layer\u00e2\u0080\u008dAt the core of Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI readiness is MetisVM, a custom virtual machine built to support intelligent applications. It enables developers to:Run AI models directly within smart contractsVerify model inputs and outputs entirely onchainOptimize performance using AI specific opcodes and tailored execution patternsTogether, these capabilities transform the blockchain from a passive ledger into an active reasoning engine capable of inference, coordination, and verifiable automation at scale. For a deeper technical dive into the AI features of Hyperion check out our DevRel Pavel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Youtube video overview here.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008dBuilding the Foundation for Human Aligned AI\u00e2\u0080\u008dAs decentralized AI matures, it needs more than compute power. It needs values baked into its infrastructure. With Hyperion, Metis is delivering the tools to build human aligned AI from the ground up. This is not just about ownership. It is about agency. It is about ensuring that the intelligence we create remains answerable to the people it is meant to serve.Visit the Hyperion Forum to join discussions, participate in the $200k HyperHack, and follow Metis socials to stay up to date.

Notably, Metis is now the first official sponsor of a Korean baseball team\u00e2\u0080\u0094a strategic move to deepen regional presence. Meanwhile, Vietnam is emerging as a major target market, with our CEO, Tom Ngo, confirmed to speak at Super Vietnam in Da Nang, a city being developed as the country's AI and blockchain innovation hub.Beyond events and IRL campaigns, the spotlight now turns to Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s multi-phase launch, which includes a testnet rollout, community engagement through forums, and the upcoming HyperHack builder campaign.Why Hyperion, Why Now?Hyperion is not just another Layer 2, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a purpose-built network optimized for real-time, compute-intensive, and AI-native applications. The launch campaign is designed not only to activate the network but to ignite a grassroots movement that brings developers, thinkers, and community builders into active collaboration.Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growing AI focus is intentional, and LazAI, one of the ecosystem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first AI-native protocols, is being incubated directly by Metis. We believe in growing AI-based projects on Hyperion, which ensures both technical readiness and ecosystem alignment.The Role of the Hyperion ForumLast week, Metis launched the Hyperion Forum, which serves as the heart of the launch campaign. But this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a typical governance forum, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designed to be a true bottom-up governance mechanism.Here are the key differences:Traditional blockchain governance tends to be top-down, even when community votes are involved. Big token holders often dictate outcomes.Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forum flips this model by encouraging discourse first\u00e2\u0080\u0094ideas, critiques, and collaborations emerge organically from the community before growing into implementable initiatives.We at Metis emphasize that this structure allows builders, marketers, and non-technical contributors alike to shape the future of the Hyperion ecosystem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is governance, really? At its core, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the collective power to influence change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Daniel explained. The forum becomes a space where ideas can evolve from conversation to execution.Forum Use Cases: From Ideas to ImpactWhether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a proposal for a new Hyperion feature, a critique of existing tooling, or a seed idea for an AI-powered agent app, the forum gives these discussions a home. Over time, the most resonant ideas can grow into full-fledged projects. Contributors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to protocol-level changes; they can influence product direction, ecosystem collaboration, and tooling.Importantly, builders have lacked a focused space to interact. The forum is designed to change that, offering not just a launchpad for ideas but a hub for serious technical and strategic discussion.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next: HyperHack and Community MilestonesLooking ahead, HyperHack kicked off on May 12 with the Application and Ideathon phase and will enter to the 2nd phase, Building, on Jun 2. This three-month Hackathon will bring developers into the fold with incentives, recognition, and a push to explore Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI and performance capabilities.Meanwhile, the forum remains open for everyone, with incentives for participation, idea generation, and engagement. Community members who consistently contribute may earn badges, gas subsidies, and visibility within the ecosystem.We invite everyone, technical or not, to get involved early because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about building dApps. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about shaping an ecosystem.Join the Forum conversation: https://forum.ceg.vote/c/hyperionRead the developer docs: https://docs.metis.io/hyperionApply for HyperHack: https://forum.ceg.vote/t/hyperhack-applications-and-ideathon-phase/4027Related PostCommunityHow to Participate in the $25,000 METIS Prediction Campaign with Nextmate.aiCommunityHyperion Weekly AMA Recap: Insights from Metis CCO Daniel KwakFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Hyperion boasts capabilities such as on-chain AI integration, real-time parallel execution, and ultra-high throughput performance. The HyperHack will enable developers to create AI-native dApps and receive rewards once their projects reach the final stage after months of testing and feedback from the community. Metis has allocated $200,000 in developer rewards for the HyperHack campaign.Question: What Type of Project Can I Build on HyperHack?Answer:\u00c2\u00a0You can build projects that demonstrate real-life use cases for the Hyperion architecture, employing an AI-first design approach. Submissions for the HyperHack campaign are divided into three main categories:Track 1 - AI-native and Core-Aligned ProjectsTrack 1 projects are AI-native dApps where AI is embedded in the logic player or product experience. AI-powered DeFi yield optimizers that adjust DeFi earning strategies are a good project under this category. Onchain AI multiplayer games, including real-time FPS games, battle games, or adventure games, are welcome in the category, and it is even better if you can use AI to optimize the speed and efficiency of the games. Adaptive governance systems, such as AI-generated policy modelling solutions for DAOs, are welcomed in this category.Protocols and platforms that bring AI and data onchain are also in this category. A decentralized marketplace for AI models with token-based access, an app marketplace that helps users choose based on some onchain metrics, is a good example of this model. Projects that can successfully integrate Hyperion's built-in co-agent, Alith, will get extra HyperHack rewards. Alith-powered DAO vetting, Alith in-game advisor solutions, or interfaces that leverage Alith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time model outputs are good examples under this category.\u00c2\u00a0Track 2 - Real-time systemsThese categories explored dApps with real-time high-throughput execution. Order books for high-frequency trading, sportsbooks with live odds calculation generation, and onchain secure communication systems also fall under this category. Real-time gaming and DeFi games with live simulation requirements and games whose incentives can change dynamically also fall under this category.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cReal-time\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to applications that necessitate low latency and high-frequency updates, which are critical for functionality and user experience.Track 3 - Infrastructure and Ecosystem ToolsThis category covers projects that advance ecosystem development, composability, and scalability. Traditional DeFi protocols that align with Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance capabilities are great examples. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and derivative markets with real-time liquidation mechanics also belong here. Smart wallets, transaction simulation tools, and on-chain debugging solutions are included, as well.Projects demonstrating how to bridge execution or liquidity between Hyperion and Andromeda, using MetisSDK examples, could involve asset and liquidity routing protocols across chains, developer toolkits, abstract bridging messaging, and contracts operating in both the Andromeda and MetisSDK environments.Bonus Track: Alith IntegrationProjects that integrate Alith (https://alith.lazai.network) into their codebase will receive a bonus point for the hackathon. Alith is a decentralized AI agent framework dedicated to creating an open, transparent, high-performance, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. Its focus on innovative AI agent development makes it ideal for the bonus track.Getting StartedTimelines and activities lined up for the Hyperion launch are available on our developer docs https://docs.metis.io/hyperionStart building on Hyperion with these easy steps:Read our introduction blog https://forum.ceg.vote/t/welcome-to-the-hyperhack-hackathon-forum/3966Read our tutorial on the Forum.https://forum.ceg.vote/t/tutorial-how-to-apply-and-submit-a-proposal/4066Complete the HyperHack application form by June 2Join the community (link)Start building on Hyperion today!Related PostCommunityMatrix RPS Badge Contest WinnerCommunityMetis TokenomicsFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

This milestone introduces two groundbreaking components: Fraud Proofs and Data Availability migration to Ethereum. Combined with Metis' existing decentralized sequencers, these upgrades transform Andromeda into the first truly decentralized Layer 2, delivering unmatched security, transparency, and scalability, and laying the foundation for the next era of high-performance, decentralized applications.Data Availability Migration: Strengthening the FoundationOur migration of Data Availability (DA) to Ethereum leverages the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, fundamentally transforming how Layer 2 data is secured and accessed. By posting transaction data directly to Ethereum L1 through blob transactions, we achieve several critical advantages:Enhanced Security Through EthereumThe migration ensures all transaction data inherits Ethereum's robust security guarantees. Rather than relying on external DA providers, every piece of data becomes permanently anchored to Ethereum's immutable ledger. This shift eliminates potential points of failure and strengthens the entire system's resilience.Improved Data Accessibility and VerificationWatchers and validators can now access transaction data directly from Ethereum, making fraud proof verification more efficient and transparent. This accessibility is crucial for maintaining network integrity, as it enables independent verification of all state transitions without relying on centralized data sources.Cost-Effective ScalingProto-Danksharding's blob transactions significantly reduce data posting costs, making Layer 2 transactions more economical while maintaining robust security. This efficiency doesn't come at the expense of decentralization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 instead, it enhances it by making network participation more accessible.Fraud Proofs: The Guardian of Network IntegrityThe implementation of fraud proofs represents a major advancement in network security. This system enables anyone to challenge invalid transactions or state roots, creating a robust, community-driven security mechanism:Decentralized Security EnforcementBy allowing any participant to become a watcher, we distribute security responsibilities across the network. This democratization of security ensures no single entity controls the validation process, strengthening the network's resistance to manipulation.Accountable State TransitionsThe 7-day challenge window provides ample time for watchers to identify and prove fraudulent activities. When invalid states are detected, the system automatically reverts the fraudulent transactions and implements slashing penalties for malicious actors.The Power of Combined DecentralizationWhen these upgrades merge with our existing decentralized sequencers, they create an unprecedented level of decentralization in Layer 2 solutions:Complete Decentralization TriadDecentralized Sequencers: Enable distributed transaction ordering and executionEthereum-based Data Availability: Ensures transparent, accessible transaction dataCommunity-driven Fraud Proofs: Provide decentralized security enforcementThis three-pronged approach eliminates traditional centralization vectors, creating a truly trustless and decentralized Layer 2 environment. Each component reinforces the others, forming a robust and secure ecosystem that maintains high performance without compromising decentralization.Sequencer Upgrade Instructions:The Andromeda Upgrade activates key decentralization features\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fraud Proofs and Data Availability (DA) on Ethereum. To support this, all sequencer operators must complete the following steps to prepare their infrastructure.Key Dates and Required ActionsStarting Now: Beacon API Readiness Sequencer nodes must support the Ethereum Mainnet Beacon API by the time of the upgrade. Ensure your setup includes support for the following endpoints:eth/v1/node/versioneth/v1/beacon/genesiseth/v1/config/speceth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/${slot}These endpoints must return valid responses when pointed to Ethereum Mainnet.May 12: Configuration Update The Metis team will publish the block height for the hardfork. Sequencer operators must:Update the Themis configuration with the hardfork block number.Restart the Themis node so the changes take effect.May 14 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Upgrade Activation On the upgrade day:Upgrade the sequencer node to the latest version released by Metis.This step finalizes the activation of both Fraud Proofs and Ethereum blob DA posting.Moving ForwardThe Andromeda Upgrade sets a new standard for Layer 2 solutions, demonstrating that true decentralization is not only possible but essential for the future of blockchain scaling. By addressing security, data availability, and transaction execution through a decentralized framework, Metis is building the foundation for the next generation of blockchain applications.This comprehensive approach to decentralization creates the perfect foundation for future innovations, particularly in high-performance applications like AI and DeFi, where security and decentralization are paramount. The Andromeda Upgrade isn't just an improvement\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's a complete reimagining of what Layer 2 solutions can achieve.Related PostCommunityLiquid Staking Token Protocols: Powering Decentralization and Economic Incentives on MetisTechnologyMETIS LAYER 2 ALPHA TESTNET HAS LAUNCHEDFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

It was symbolic at best, clunky at worst. Actual execution of large language model (LLM) inference on-chain, inside a blockchain-native environment, remained a pipe dream - limited by cost, performance, and architectural gaps.Imagine decentralized applications (dApps) smart enough to analyze, predict, and adapt to user needs dynamically. Blockchain technology is transformative in many ways but is also limited in processing complex AI computations efficiently on-chain. This gap prevents the full integration of AI's powerful capabilities within decentralized ecosystems, leaving many applications reliant on centralized, off-chain solutions that compromise transparency, security, and trust.We needed a new kind of L2 - AI-native, blockchain-secure, and developer-first.Today, with the launch of Hyperion's testnet, we bridge this critical gap by bringing fully functional, high-performance AI directly onto the blockchain.The Problem: Why Blockchain Needs Integrated AIBlockchain technology promises decentralization, immutability, and transparency. However, current implementations struggle with the intensive computational demands of AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). Running AI models off-chain introduces vulnerabilities and reduces transparency, contradicting blockchain's decentralized ethos. Additionally, high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and security concerns around AI integration have remained major roadblocks..The Solution: Introducing Hyperion\u00c2\u00a0Hyperion, developed with the powerful Metis SDK and LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alith AI framework, is the first Layer 2 Ethereum-compatible solution designed explicitly for on-chain AI execution, notably supporting Large Language Models (LLMs). It combines blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decentralized trust and transparency with AI's analytical and predictive powers, delivering an unparalleled user and developer experience.In-Depth Technical Look: Hyperion's ArchitectureLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break down the core architecture that powers on-chain LLM execution on Hyperion.Metis SDK - The BackboneHyperion harnesses the scalability of the Metis SDK's Optimistic Rollups and Decentralized Sequencers. These technologies drastically reduce transaction costs and enhance scalability, making it feasible to execute complex AI computations on-chain without compromising performance.Optimistic rollup and decentralized sequencers design for scalabilityPrecompiled contract integration for performance-sensitive tasksDeveloper-friendly interfaces for building EVM-compatible appsAlith - The AI EngineThe Alith framework provides the core AI integration, designed from the ground up for blockchain compatibility. Using Rust-based model inference, Alith ensures high throughput and low latency for AI tasks, significantly outperforming existing solutions.Inference Engine: Optimized for low-latency execution of LLMs and other models using Rust + WASM runtimes.Workflow Coordinator: Chains AI tasks (e.g. prompt \u00e2\u0086\u0092 response \u00e2\u0086\u0092 action) as verifiable steps.Multi-modal Interfaces: Accepts data in various formats, enabling LLMs, computer vision models, and even structured data pipelines.On-chain Integration: Includes contracts and tooling to let devs trigger AI tasks from smart contracts, using standard call semantics.Developer Experience: Bringing On-Chain AI to LifeLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk through how a dev might build with Hyperion + Alith:Write an AI Agent using Alith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SDK. This includes model selection, inference logic, and fallback behaviors.Deploy it on-chain as a module accessible via precompiled contract logic in Hyperion.Call it from smart contracts whether it's a chatbot, a prediction engine, or a DAO assistant.Verify outputs through anchor logs, reproducible inference, or trusted enclaves.Compose outputs into other dApps e.g., LLM-generated risk profiles triggering a DeFi protocol limit switch.For example, a DAO could integrate a Hyperion-based Alith agent to summarize proposals, forecast voting outcomes, and flag anomalies - all verifiably, on-chain, and without ever leaving the trust-minimized environment.Key Features of HyperionHyperion introduces a comprehensive set of features designed specifically for efficient blockchain-AI integration:High Scalability and EfficiencyHyperion leverages Optimistic Rollups and Decentralized Sequencers from Metis SDK, ensuring rapid transaction confirmation and reduced computational overhead.Rust-Based High-Performance InferenceAlith's optimized Rust implementation enables fast, scalable, and cost-effective execution of AI tasks directly on-chain, critical for real-time decentralized AI applications.Advanced Security Through TEEAlith utilizes Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), safeguarding sensitive AI data and computations, ensuring integrity and privacy within decentralized systems.Multi-Language AI Model SupportAlith supports diverse AI models and multiple programming languages, offering flexibility and ease of integration for developers from various technical backgrounds.Transparent On-Chain AI TasksAll AI processes performed via Hyperion are transparently recorded on-chain, promoting accountability, audibility, and enhanced user trust.Real-World Use CasesHyperion opens diverse and transformative possibilities:Intelligent DeFi Trading BotsAI-powered bots that analyze market trends, predict price movements, automate and optimize trading decisions on-chain.Dynamic NFT Pricing & Market AnalyticsUse AI to dynamically adjust NFT pricing based on market trends, metadata analysis, and consumer behavior, optimizing sales strategies.Predictive DAO GovernanceAI-driven governance platforms analyze past voting patterns, predict decision outcomes, and optimize collective decision-making for DAOs.Real-Time Blockchain Data AnalyticsAdvanced on-chain analytics tools providing real-time insights and predictive analytics, enhancing decision-making processes across various blockchain-based applications.Personalized Decentralized AI AssistantsOn-chain LLMs powering personalized AI assistants that help users navigate complex blockchain ecosystems, answer queries, and automate routine tasks.Why Choose Hyperion?Hyperion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another Layer 2 solution - it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a revolutionary leap forward in how blockchain and AI interact.

This is more than a technical milestone; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the start of a community-driven movement designed to empower developers, early users, and innovators from across the Web3 space.While spending nearly $500,000 on the campaign, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to just hold another hackathon or just another Twitter campaign. We wanted to really drive value towards the ecosystem and users. We wanted to create a time where we all get involved in the growth of Hyperion from testnet to mainnet, and create a community where the community itself is a flywheel of value.Our campaign will unfold in three key phases of exciting community campaigns, a new platform to house our community, and tons of community and developer campaigns, each designed to build momentum, drive adoption, and reward participation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all leading up to the highly anticipated Mainnet launch.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also have a series of articles to dig deep into all the campaigns, ways to get involved, and our strategy for the Hyperion Launch Campaign, so stay tuned!For a quick list of activities on the Hyperion Launch Campaign, follow the link here.Phase 1: Testnet, Forum, Hackathon LaunchThe campaign kicks off with the Testnet launch, giving developers and ecosystem partners early access to the tools and infrastructure that will power the network. To accelerate innovation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hosting a global Hackathon, inviting builders to experiment, deploy dApps, and stress-test the chain.All of this will be centred around the new Forum we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built, a place where Metisians can come together to drive innovation, community building, and just a fun place to be in general. It is the start of our \u00e2\u0080\u009cbottom-up governance by action through discussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009dParticipants will compete for recognition, prizes, and new types of perks, helping shape the first wave of applications on our chain.Phase 2: Incentivized Campaigns for Users & DevelopersOver the following months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll roll out a series of incentivized campaigns aimed at both users and developers.

Developers often need a reliable way to serve data to their frontends without relying solely on RPC calls, which can be slow, limited, or difficult to scale.In this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Metis developer workshop, we were joined by Marcus Rein, Developer Relations at The Graph, for an in-depth session on building subgraphs. The focus was on understanding how subgraphs provide structured, queryable, and performant access to blockchain data\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially useful for applications building on the Metis Layer 2 ecosystem.This post recaps the key takeaways from the workshop, along with supporting resources and code.Workshop Recording: Watch the full session on YouTubeCode Repository: Subgraph Dev Workshop GitHubUnderstanding the Role of SubgraphsA subgraph is a powerful tool that enables developers to index and query blockchain data using GraphQL. It provides a structured, API-like interface over blockchain data, and allows applications to retrieve specific datasets efficiently and reliably.While direct smart contract queries through libraries like ethers.js can be effective in small use cases, they quickly become limited when dealing with large volumes of data, cross-contract relationships, or complex filtering logic.Subgraphs offer the following advantages:High-performance GraphQL querying capabilitiesReal-time access to indexed blockchain eventsCustomizable schema and transformations for application-specific needsSeamless integration with modern frontend frameworksOptional deployment to a decentralized network for fault-tolerant indexingWhy Subgraphs Matter for Metis DevelopersIn the context of Metis, subgraphs unlock significant value for teams building DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAO dashboards, or analytics-driven applications.Use cases include:Building user portfolio dashboards with onchain lending, borrowing, or staking dataTracking governance events or smart contract proposal voting historiesIndexing NFT ownership and transfers for collectibles and gaming assetsPowering Telegram or Discord bots with real-time blockchain updatesBy leveraging subgraphs, developers reduce reliance on centralized infrastructure and gain more control over how data is accessed and served.Workshop Overview: What We BuiltDuring the workshop, the following steps were demonstrated:Setting up The Graph CLI and environmentInitializing a subgraph project using a smart contract addressIndexing smart contract events and transforming them into database entitiesRunning the subgraph in a local development environmentWriting GraphQL queries to retrieve structured dataUnderstanding how subgraphs can be extended and published to The Graph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decentralized indexing networkAlthough the demonstration was conducted using Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CryptoPunks contract, the process is fully applicable to any EVM-compatible chain, including Metis.Technical OverviewThe workshop introduced three key components of a subgraph:1.\u00c2\u00a0subgraph.yamlThis is the manifest file that defines the smart contracts, start block, and data sources to be indexed. It also specifies the relationship between contract events and their corresponding event handlers (mappings).2.\u00c2\u00a0schema.graphqlDefines the shape of the data stored in the subgraph. This includes entities, field types, and relationships. It serves as the schema for GraphQL queries.3. Mapping Handlers (*.ts)These TypeScript files contain the logic for transforming event data into entities that match the defined schema. Each event is handled through a function that extracts the relevant data and stores it in the subgraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.Example transformation:export function handleAssign(event: AssignEvent): void {\n  let entity = new Assign(event.transaction.hash.toHex() + \"-\" + event.logIndex.toString());\n  entity.to = event.params.to;\n  entity.punkIndex = event.params.punkIndex;\n  entity.save();\n}This logic creates an entity for each Assign event, generates a unique ID, and stores the event data in the subgraph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.Querying the SubgraphOnce deployed, the subgraph exposes a GraphQL endpoint. Developers can then use this endpoint to query indexed data with high precision and performance.Example query to fetch recent transfers:{\n  transfers(first: 10, orderBy: blockTimestamp, orderDirection: desc) {\n    from\n    to\n    value\n    blockTimestamp\n  }\n}GraphQL queries are strongly typed and flexible, allowing developers to request exactly the data they need without over-fetching.Deployment OptionsThe Graph offers two main deployment options:Subgraph Studio (free, centralized): Best for development and testing. Includes a hosted playground and limited-rate endpoint (up to 3,000 queries/day).Graph Network (decentralized): Suitable for production deployments. Queries are served by decentralized indexers, with support for incentivization via the GRT token.The workshop covered how to deploy to Studio and test queries using the built-in GraphQL playground.Integrating with FrontendsSubgraph endpoints can be queried directly from modern web frameworks such as:React (via Apollo Client)Next.jsVue.jsSvelteThe Graph Studio also provides prebuilt query templates and code snippets to make integration fast and seamless.ResourcesThe Graph DocumentationSubgraph StudioMarcus Rein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Subgraph Workshop RepoMetis ExplorerLooking AheadIn our next session with The Graph, we will go deeper into subgraph development, covering:Working with multiple contracts in one subgraphAdvanced filtering and entity relationshipsPublishing to the decentralized indexing layerBest practices for query optimization and securityThese topics will help developers unlock even more from the data available on Metis.Stay ConnectedWe host technical workshops every week focused on tooling, infrastructure, and decentralized development within the Metis ecosystem.

In this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hyperion Weekly AMA, Metis CCO Daniel Kwak walked through Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role within the ecosystem, technical differentiators, and what builders and users can expect in the months ahead.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the full breakdown for those who missed it:Why is Metis Launching Hyperion?Hyperion is not a replacement for Andromeda. Instead, it is the next phase of Metis' evolution into a multi-network ecosystem.Andromeda: Focused on traditional Web3 applications\u00e2\u0080\u0094DeFi, DAOs, NFTs\u00e2\u0080\u0094with security and decentralization as primary pillars.Hyperion: Built to meet the growing demand for real-time, compute-heavy, and AI-native dApps that require faster execution, parallel processing, and flexible scaling.Hyperion is designed specifically for future-facing use cases like agent-based systems, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), real-time gaming, and high-frequency trading (HFT)\u00e2\u0080\u0094categories that strain the performance limits of conventional Layer 2s.Core Technical Differences: Hyperion vs. AndromedaDaniel outlined the major architectural upgrades Hyperion brings:Parallel Execution: Unlike typical optimistic rollups that process transactions sequentially, Hyperion uses parallel execution to dramatically increase throughput.Real-Time Sequencer: Designed for instant finality and low-latency interactions, critical for AI and HFT applications.High-Performance Infrastructure: Modular design using the Metis SDK enables developers to eventually create custom Layer 2s or Layer 3s (\"LayerX\") for specialized needs.Built-In AI Inference Capabilities: Native precompiles will allow on-chain AI agent operations without depending solely on ZK proofs or centralized infrastructures.In short: Hyperion is optimized for applications that demand responsiveness and scalability far beyond what traditional L2s can offer.Shared Economy: Gas Token and Ecosystem InteroperabilityDaniel confirmed that Hyperion and Andromeda will share the same gas token \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $METIS.In addition:Unified Ecosystem: Both networks are connected via the Metis SDK, ensuring fast asset flow, account abstraction, and seamless developer experience across chains.Paymasters Model: Hyperion will integrate native paymasters to allow projects to cover gas costs for users, removing onboarding friction for mainstream adoption.Projects will have options to use LST yields or protocol incentives to fund user gas, improving UX.This design ensures economic unity and developer composability across the expanding Metis ecosystem.Key Use Cases Hyperion TargetsDaniel reiterated that Hyperion is not just another general-purpose chain. It is purpose-built to unlock new possibilities in:On-chain AI Agents: Secure, verifiable agent computation natively on-chain.Real-Time GameFi: Support real-time PvP gaming, micro-payments, and AI-enhanced gameplay.DePIN Projects: Power decentralized physical infrastructure and real-time sensor data applications.HFT and Finance: Enable ultra-fast decentralized trading tools.This makes Hyperion the natural choice for builders pushing the boundaries of real-time Web3 applications.Community Q&A HighlightsKey highlights of the Q&A with community:Liquid Staking and Restaking: Metis will integrate third-party builders and protocols to offer staking and restaking infrastructure for both Andromeda and Hyperion.Data Availability Improvements: Metis is moving toward Ethereum Layer 1-based DA improvements to support even greater security and scalability.Decentralized Sequencer Network: Hyperion will leverage Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decentralized sequencer approach to ensure liveness and resistance against censorship, even if individual nodes fail.Bridging and Finality: Hyperion will initially launch with Optimistic Rollup finality (7-day withdrawal period) but is exploring ZK-based finality options to accelerate cross-chain usability.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coming NextMetis CCO, Daniel Kwak, wrapped up with a roadmap preview for the coming months:Expanded Hyperion Testnet Access: More users and builders will be onboarded soon.Developer Bootcamp: Launching in June 2025, designed to help Web2 and AI developers build dApps and agents on Hyperion.Early Contributor Rewards: Programs like the Hyperion Voyage and Builder Whitelists are already running and will expand.Mainnet Launch Timeline: Hyperion is on track for mainnet in mid-2025, following expanded testnet validation and ecosystem onboarding.Final ThoughtsThe Hyperion Weekly AMA made it clear that Metis is not just scaling\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving. Hyperion represents a major step forward in blockchain design, specifically engineered for the AI-driven, real-time Web3 future.Metis is positioning itself as the home for builders who want to go beyond DeFi and DAOs, embracing complex, high-performance, intelligent applications that the next generation of users will demand.Weekly AMAs will continue to provide updates, progress checks, and open discussion as Hyperion approaches mainnet.Stay tuned\u00e2\u0080\u0094and get ready to build.Quick Highlights for Those Who Missed It:Hyperion expands Metis into a dual-network ecosystemParallel execution enables real-time, AI-native applicationsHyperion and Andromeda share the $METIS token and SDKNative paymasters will abstract gas fees for better UXDeveloper bootcamp and expanded testnet access coming soon\u00e2\u0080\u008dRelated PostEcosystemRevitalizing Metis DeFi: ENKI as the First Decentralized Sequencer Reboot ParticipantCommunityMetis SDK & Hyperion AMA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 By Metis CCO Daniel KwakFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

The Data Anchoring Token (DAT) System provides tokenized AI assets with verifiable provenance and programmable access control, while an iDAO (Individual-centric DAO) framework enables community-driven AI validation.Development ExperienceHyperion is using the MetisSDK, which is a specialized toolkit designed to enhance the performance of the network, by enabling parallel transaction execution. Rather than processing transactions sequentially (one after another), the MetisSDK allows multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously, leveraging modern multi-core processors to significantly speed up block processing. The MetisSDK released with these capabilities:Performance: Significantly faster block processing by utilizing multiple CPU coresCorrectness: Despite parallel execution, results are equivalent to sequential processingExtensibility: Support for custom extensions like AI servicesFurther Optimization: Optional bytecode compilation for even greater speedValue PropositionMetis Hyperion with LazAI positions itself as the most comprehensive blockchain infrastructure for sophisticated AI applications, specifically addressing the technical challenges that have previously limited blockchain's viability for AI workloads. Its value lies in combining real-time performance, AI-native execution capabilities, verifiable data governance, and developer-friendly tools.2. ModeTechnical Architecture & PerformanceAs a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network operating within the Optimism ecosystem (part of the \"Superchain\"), Mode leverages existing L2 scaling technologies. While specific performance metrics aren't detailed in the provided information, Mode cites being the \"third biggest ecosystem in the Superchain,\" implying substantial adoption and infrastructure.AI IntegrationMode's integration of AI focuses more on application-level functionality rather than protocol-level optimizations. Key components include:An AI-secured L2 sequencer for enhanced security monitoringOnchain agent infrastructure through partnerships with Olas, Giza, and RPS AIThe Synth Subnet project on Bittensor's network for generating synthetic price path dataEconomic Model & ProductsMode is creating what it terms the \"AIFi Economy\", an AI-enabled financial infrastructure and interfaces designed to scale DeFi to billions of users globally. Its product suite includes:Mode Trade: A comprehensive trading platform with perpetual trading, AI integration, and synthetic asset dataAI Terminal: A text-based command interface for simplifying complex trading operationsAIFi Wallet: A consumer-facing wallet application with AI-powered capabilitiesValue PropositionMode's unique value proposition centers on creating an ecosystem where AI agents and machine learning models can execute onchain transactions across DeFi protocols. The platform envisions a financial system powered by agent-to-agent (AI2AI) interactions, making DeFi more accessible through automation and improved usability.3. Sahara AITechnical Architecture & Data GovernanceSahara AI implements a four-layer architecture:Application Layer: User interface and interaction pointsTransaction Layer: Blockchain infrastructure for provenance and transactionsData Layer: For data storage, access, and transferExecution Layer: Off-chain infrastructure supporting AI computationThe platform establishes clear ownership of AI assets (data, models, agents) with transparent attribution and compensation mechanisms for contributors.Governance & Economic ModelSahara AI employs decentralized governance through the Sahara DAO with support from the Sahara Foundation. Its economic system defines specific roles (developers, knowledge providers, consumers, validators) and implements dual growth flywheels connecting Web3 and AI ecosystems.Value PropositionSahara AI's core value proposition is democratizing AI by addressing the current concentration of AI power among few organizations. The platform emphasizes sovereignty (user control over AI assets), provenance (transparent attribution), collaboration, privacy protection, and fair compensation. Its mission is to transform AI from a centrally controlled resource to one that empowers individuals, businesses, and communities worldwide.4. NEAR AITechnical Architecture & Privacy FocusNEAR AI's technical architecture centers on privacy-preserving technology and open-source infrastructure. Key technological components include:Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) using specialized hardware (Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs)Proof of Response mechanism to guarantee service liveness in decentralized systemsDecentralized Confidential Machine Learning (DCML) framework combining TEEs with payment channelsAgent Interaction and Transaction Protocol (AITP) for secure agent communicationAI Research & DevelopmentNEAR AI is building a 1.4T parameter frontier AI model (3.4x larger than Meta's Llama) using a decentralized approach with continuous competitions. The organization is also part of the Open Agents Alliance (OAA), collaborating with teams like Coinbase Onramp & AgentKit to deliver open-source AI services.Value PropositionNEAR AI's distinctive value proposition centers on \"User-Owned AI\", ensuring users maintain control of their data and AI interactions while making frontier AI models available in a permissionless fashion. The organization emphasizes privacy-preservation, sustainable monetization models for open-source AI, and global accessibility, aiming to provide AI services to all 5.5 billion internet users rather than just the current blockchain community.5. BittensorPeer-to-Peer Intelligence MarketUnlike the other platforms, Bittensor functions primarily as a decentralized market for machine intelligence rather than a traditional blockchain platform with AI features. Its core innovation is moving away from benchmark-based evaluation of AI toward a system where intelligence itself becomes a commodity that is mined, valued, and transacted.Technical Architecture & Network DesignIn the Bittensor network:Participants (called \"peers\") are neural networks that share representations across the internetPeers rank each other by measuring the value of signals they receiveA \"consensus\" mechanism ensures that peers must be trusted by over 50% of network stake to receive rewardsThe system incorporates bond ownership, conditional computation, and knowledge distillationValue PropositionBittensor's unique value proposition is creating an efficient market for machine intelligence through peer evaluation rather than centralized benchmarks. This approach aims to enable a more diverse ecosystem of AI systems that can find unique niches rather than competing in winner-takes-all environments. By making intelligence itself a tradable commodity, Bittensor potentially allows for more efficient production and valuation of AI capabilities.Comparative AnalysisTechnical Architecture ComparisonAI Integration ApproachConclusionThe convergence of AI and blockchain technology is still in its early phases, with each platform taking distinctive approaches to this integration. Metis Hyperion focuses on protocol-level optimizations for AI performance, with LazAI focusing on the data-alignment for AI through\u00c2\u00a0 through iDAO-driven governance, Mode targets DeFi applications with AI enhancements, Sahara AI emphasizes democratization and ownership, NEAR AI prioritizes privacy and user control, while Bittensor creates a marketplace for intelligence itself.These different approaches reflect the multifaceted nature of the AI-blockchain relationship and suggest that the space is still evolving toward optimal architectural patterns and business models. The success of these platforms will likely depend on their ability to deliver tangible value through actual applications while addressing the inherent challenges of both technologies.As the AI-blockchain ecosystem continues to mature, we can expect increasing specialization among platforms, with some focusing on specific vertical applications while others provide more general-purpose infrastructure. The convergence of these technologies holds significant promise for creating more transparent, accessible, and efficient AI systems while simultaneously enhancing blockchain functionality through embedded intelligence.Related PostTechnologyAccelerating Dapps and Decentralized Economies with Metis and CasperLabsEcosystemMetis EDF: A New Chapter for MetisFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

As Metis expands its innovative footprint in the Layer 2 ecosystem, clearly distinguishing Andromeda from Metis itself is critical. Andromeda isn't Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0094Metis forms the foundational layer of a broader ecosystem, paving the way for scalable decentralized infrastructure. Understanding the Difference: Metis vs. AndromedaAt first glance, you might mistake Andromeda as synonymous with Metis. Yet, clearly differentiating their roles is key to grasping Metis' expansive vision:Metis is not just another blockchain; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a comprehensive Layer 2 platform purposefully designed to address Ethereum's scalability, decentralization, usability, and interoperability challenges. Metis hosts specialized blockchain networks, each targeting unique market needs:Hyperion: An AI-driven execution layer optimized to support high-performance, computationally intensive AI inference applications.LazAI: A next-generation blockchain network and protocol specifically created to address the AI data alignment problem.Andromeda: A high-performance, Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network, specifically designed to support decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.Thus, Andromeda is a crucial piece\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not the entirety\u00e2\u0080\u0094of Metis' strategic vision, enabled by the powerful Metis SDK.\u00e2\u009a\u0099 Metis SDK: The Real Game ChangerAt the heart of Metis is the revolutionary Metis SDK, a developer-centric framework reshaping how blockchain networks are constructed and deployed. It unlocks unprecedented scalability, versatility, and interoperability\u00e2\u0080\u0094an all-in-one solution for building high-performance, real-time Web3 ecosystems.The Metis SDK doesn't transform the Metis token itself into a programmable asset, but rather, Metis provides developers with programmable tools through the SDK. This allows developers to build groundbreaking applications, advance decentralized infrastructure, and deliver exceptional user experiences.\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5 Hyperion: Showcasing Metis SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PotentialHyperion vividly demonstrates the transformative capabilities of the Metis SDK:Decentralized Sequencer Nodes: Decentralizing transaction sequencing to enhance network security and resilience.AI-Native Capabilities: Optimizing and supporting computationally intensive, on-chain AI inference applications\u00e2\u0080\u0094empowering developers to integrate advanced AI directly within decentralized applications.Parallel Transaction Execution: Speculative parallel execution dramatically boosts throughput and reduces latency, paving the way for real-time, responsive blockchain applications.Hyperion exemplifies the innovation and specialized networks that the Metis SDK enables.\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0096 LazAI: Contextualizing SDK FlexibilityWhile not the central topic of this discussion, it's valuable to mention LazAI briefly, as it underscores the SDK's versatility. LazAI is a protocol-layer infrastructure built to power a fully decentralized AI ecosystem where AI data, models, and interactions are verifiable, tokenized, and composable. Its modular three-layer architecture (Application, Execution, Extension) demonstrates another powerful, real-world example of what the Metis SDK can achieve.Specifically, LazAI leverages the Metis SDK to power its Execution Layer, utilizing an EVM-compatible LazVM to handle AI computations, gas settlements, and a robust decentralized Quorum-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u0094demonstrating the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader applicability beyond Hyperion and Andromeda.\u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 Future Vision: Expanding the Metis SDK InfrastructureMetis is committed to continuous improvement and broader infrastructure expansion, with clear, tangible goals:Enhanced Decentralization & Security: Progressive decentralization via the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Network, ensuring network robustness and resistance to censorship.Cross-Chain Interoperability: Seamless integration through solutions like Metis Shared Bridge and Unified Account Abstraction, allowing smooth asset and data flow across different blockchain ecosystems.Further AI Integration: Continued growth in AI-driven solutions, building on successes from Hyperion and LazAI, solving real-world problems such as AI data alignment and computation complexity.Developer Initiatives: Strengthening support through extensive documentation, robust tooling, workshops, and developer-focused community initiatives.With these strategic expansions, Metis positions itself as the leading scalable, adaptable, and developer-focused Web3 infrastructure.\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u0090 Beyond Layer 2: Redefining ScalableClearly separating Andromeda from the overarching Metis ecosystem aligns perfectly with Metis' long-term scalable blockchain infrastructure strategy. Metis is not a singular Layer 2 solution\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is a multi-network ecosystem, fostering interconnected blockchain networks. By fostering interconnected networks, each tailored to specific use cases and communities, Metis redefines scalable blockchain infrastructure. With the innovative Metis SDK, this ecosystem gains a powerful platform to enable and thrive in a decentralized, multi-network future.In this multi-network ecosystem:Andromeda lays the decentralized, Ethereum-compatible foundational layer.Hyperion showcases the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities through AI-native application support.LazAI demonstrates versatility by addressing complex AI alignment challenges.These networks are initial demonstrations of the expansive possibilities unlocked by the Metis SDK.\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u008c Conclusion: Andromeda Is Only the BeginningClearly defining Andromeda as distinct from Metis highlights Metis' ambitious, strategic vision. Powered by the transformative Metis SDK, Andromeda provides the foundational infrastructure for decentralized applications. Hyperion and LazAI are groundbreaking proof points illustrating the vast potential for innovation within this ecosystem.This is only the beginning of a scalable, innovative, decentralized, multi-network blockchain future\u00e2\u0080\u0094an expansive vision clearly defined and driven by the Metis SDK.Welcome to a new era defined clearly by the Metis SDK.Related PostEcosystemMetis x Artemis: Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan for Stage 1CommunityMetis: Your One-Stop Network for NFTsFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

LazAI is working to ensure that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just aligned with human values but also open and accessible to everyone. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stepping into an exciting new chapter for Metis.With so much potential ahead of us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to pause and reflect. We shouldn't build just for the sake of building. We need to think about where this technology is taking us - and how we can shape it to create an ecosystem that delivers real value, not just for businesses but for everyday people too.Today, I want to talk to you - our amazing community - about one of Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core values: governance. I touched on this briefly at the ETHDenver kickoff, but now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to dive deeper. Not just into governance on Metis, but into something even more exciting: the vision of how people and AI can come together.BackgroundA quick recap of recent developments and announcements at Metis: 1. Metis ReGenesis is a refocusing of Metis on not only driving real value and use cases but also on the next step for the blockchain space \u00e2\u0080\u0093 AI. 2. As part of ReGenesis, we are launching a new chain to build a home for AI (Hyperion) that will coexist with Andromeda while incubating LazAI which will solve the data-alignment problem and democratization of AI assets. 3. Governance on Metis will evolve into more than a simple voting mechanism \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a gathering of discussions, ideas, and most importantly, the potential for action and thus value. 4. In exploring the applications of Alith, LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homegrown AI agent framework, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a chance to envision what is not only the potential but the ideal in which we may all work towards.Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dig in, starting with the historical context.The Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and HumansPhilosophical RootsThroughout history, philosophers have sought to build societies where everyone feels free and happy. Many thinkers, from Socrates to modern philosophers, have debated governance models that balance power, virtue, and reason. Despite various societal advancements, no system has fully achieved this goal.One common thread among the great philosophers is that any society should be led or governed by highly educated, reasonable, and virtuous individuals who can predict the consequences of decisions and guide society toward prosperity, freedom, and happiness.Plato: Proposed the \"Philosopher-King\" model, arguing that the wisest and virtuous individuals should rule rather than those born into power or wealth. Only those with deep philosophical knowledge and rational thinking can govern justly, as they seek truth over personal gain.Aristotle: Advocated for the balance of wisdom, virtue, and participation. Insight: The best rulers are those trained in virtue, ethics, and reason, ensuring that decisions are made for the common good.Confucius. Confucian philosophy emphasizes that rulers must be wise, virtuous, and morally upright (the concept of Ren - benevolence).Immanuel Kant: Kant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s categorical imperative suggests that moral laws should be universal and based on reason rather than emotion or self-interest.The list doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end there, as the likes of John Stuart Mill, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Hayek, Yuval Noah Harari, and more have all come to similar conclusions. As shown, numerous great thinkers have all pointed towards the same idea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rulers must be wise, virtuous, and based on reason.Historical PrecedentsHistorically, some of the most successful governance models followed these philosophers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 insights:Singapore:\u00c2\u00a0 Lee Kuan Yew (Plato & Aristotle). He prioritized governance by highly educated and virtuous leaders. Singapore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government carefully selected and trained its leaders, ensuring that the most capable individuals made key policy decisions. Singapore transformed from a poor, unstable city-state in the 1960s to one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced economies.United States:\u00c2\u00a0 The Founding Fathers (Locke & Montesquieu). The U.S. Constitution was designed around Locke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, liberty, and property principles. A system of checks and balances (inspired by Montesquieu) was implemented to prevent tyranny and ensure governance by reason and law. Early American leaders like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton focused on education, rational governance, and long-term planning. The U.S. became the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful democracy, leading in innovation, economic growth, and individual freedoms.Switzerland:\u00c2\u00a0 Decentralized Governance (Montesquieu & Hayek). Swiss leaders prioritize rational, evidence-based governance, avoiding political extremes. Switzerland remains one of the wealthiest and most stable countries in the world.More examples: Germany in Post-WWII Reconstruction (Immanuel Kant & Hayek), South Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scientific and Rational Leadership (Confucius & Locke), China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Technocratic Governance (Confucius & Legalism)AI as the Modern Philosopher-KingIn the present era, AI is the most educated \"individual\" in the world. It has vast knowledge, the ability to predict outcomes, and can offer valuable insights. However, it must not replace human governance but act as an advisor - a concept we call the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans.This tandem ensures AI serves as a highly educated advisor while humans retain decision-making power, applying ethical and emotional intelligence to any decision.Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Unique PositionMetis is uniquely positioned to implement the Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans due to its commitment to decentralization across multiple layers:\u00c2\u00a0Decentralized Sequencers (MetisL2 & GOAT Network) - Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions, MetisL2 operates on a fully decentralized sequencer model, ensuring no single entity can control the network. This decentralized architecture naturally aligns with the ideology of distributed wisdom and fairness, preventing centralization risks in AI-assisted governance.Cross-Chain Reach - Metis is not confined to a single ecosystem. The upcoming Metis SDK allows seamless interoperability between other chains, and by bridging Ethereum (MetisL2), Bitcoin (GOAT), and other networks, Metis ensures interoperability and decentralization at a global scale that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confined to a single ecosystem.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0New Paradigm in AI Assetization and Democratization - With everything from verified computing, iDAOs (individual-centric DAOs) that manage these assets, DATs (Data Anchoring Tokens) to allow accessible assetization while anchoring the full lifecycle of AI assets from models to agents, LazAI provides a holistic solution to the AI alignment problem. The core problem that LazAI is solving - the AI alignment problem - is the same core of the AI we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to ensure that true AI governance aligns with human needs and vision.The Meaning of Metis. In Greek, Metis (\u00ce\u009c\u00e1\u00bf\u0086\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0082) means wisdom, skill, or cunning intelligence. Metis's name was inspired by Greek mythology, where Metis was a Titaness of Wisdom, symbolizing the vision of an AI that enhances human wisdom rather than replacing it. This directly aligns with the ideology of a Balanced Tandem of AI and Humans, where AI serves as a knowledgeable advisor without exerting unchecked power.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0With this robust foundation in decentralization, cross-chain interoperability, and a commitment to ethical AI governance, Metis is not just another Web3 platform - it is the ideal proving ground for a decentralized AI-human collaboration model that can reshape governance, businesses, and societies for the better.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\nNo support\nSolving Real Problems Through AI-Human CollaborationThe Metis ideal of The Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans has the potential to solve a wide range of problems, spanning from global issues to smaller, yet impactful challenges within businesses and governance.Global Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveGlobal Political Inefficiencies & Misalignment with the PeoplesProblem: Governments often make uninformed, biased, or emotionally charged decisions that lead to war and economic disasters.Solution: AI can analyze historical data, predict geopolitical risks, and propose the best diplomatic strategies based on proven governance models. A decentralized, AI-assisted advisory system for world governance (similar to a non-corrupt UN) could reduce global conflicts by fostering educated, unbiased decision-making.Large-Scale Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveInefficiencies in National and Corporate GovernanceProblem: Many decisions are made based on limited knowledge, leading to policy failures and mismanagement.Solution: AI can study historical cases from the original philosophy books and historical archives of successful and failed governance, offering data-driven insights that help decision-makers predict long-term outcomes.Unstable Economic PoliciesProblem: Economic crashes and crises often result from poor financial planning and short-term decision-making.Solution: AI can analyze global economic patterns, advise governments and businesses on sustainable growth models, and help prevent reckless financial decision-making. AI access to real historical information is essential here.\u00c2\u00a0Smaller but Impactful Problems Human-Aligned AI Can SolveBusiness Decision-Making for Small EnterprisesProblem: Many small business owners lack the experience or resources to analyze market trends, competitors, and hiring strategies effectively.Solution: AI can predict market trends, suggest hiring decisions, and optimize business strategies, helping small businesses scale more efficiently. For instance, LazAI can help optimize business operations and strategies based on past performance, market trends, and best industry practices.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Decision-Making Challenges in DAOsProblem: Many DAO members lack the expertise to make informed governance decisions, leading to uninformed voting and low engagement.Solution: AI can educate DAO members on governance history, provide simulations of potential voting outcomes, and recommend the best courses of action. For instance, LazAI could analyze historical Metis CEG voting patterns, discussions, and Sybil activities, simulate outcomes of proposals, and recommend adjustments to maximize community benefit.\u00c2\u00a0The Metis Ideology of AI + Human Collaboration presents a scalable, adaptable framework to solve problems across multiple levels\u00e2\u0080\u0094from global governance to small business decisions.\u00c2\u00a0Risks and SafeguardsWhile this model presents significant advantages, robust safeguards are required to prevent AI misuse. Please note that a problem is an opportunity for us to find a new solution:AI Bias and NeutralityFlaw: AI models are trained on historical data, often containing biases. Even decentralized AI can inherit biases from the sources it learns from, leading to potentially flawed recommendations.Solution: Implement LazAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solutions where possible to ensure data and human alignment, and bias detection and mitigation mechanisms in the AI training process for non-LazAI data sources. Encourage diverse contributors to AI training and governance to minimize inherent biases.The Grand Vision: Creating a Free and Happy SocietyThe Efficient and Balanced Alignment of AI and Humans is more than a concept\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is a path to a more just, free, and prosperous society. By integrating AI as an ethical and knowledgeable advisor, we can build an ecosystem where decisions are made with wisdom, ensuring freedom, growth, and innovation.Metis has already laid the foundation through LazAI and MetisL2 via Decentralized Sequencers. Now, our mission is to align all stakeholders around this vision and demonstrate its power in action.Metis is not just another Web3 economy - we are leading the charge toward a decentralized, AI-assisted future that balances intelligence with human ethics.We will create the future we believe in.\u00c2\u00a0Related PostEcosystemELI5: The Centralized Sequencer Problem in L2sCommunityCommunity Testing Season 2: Official GuideFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

What began as a race for transaction throughput has matured into a nuanced understanding that different blockchain applications require fundamentally different infrastructure optimizations. We at Metis recognized this reality, crafting a vision that transcends the limitations of single-network approaches.We are now bringing this vision to life by offering a decentralized infrastructure stack for the blockchain industry, starting with our dual-network strategy. At the core of this initiative is the MetisSDK, a new developer framework, alongside Hyperion (HYPE), a showcase chain currently under development to demonstrate the SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential. The dual-network strategy integrates Andromeda, our established foundation layer, with Hyperion, a new AI-optimized performance layer. Rather than simply adding another chain to the ecosystem, this approach establishes a complementary infrastructure that unlocks previously unattainable capabilities within the Layer 2 landscape.In short, Hyperion and Andromeda will work together to serve both niches and the general blockchain space, creating synergies through innovations such as the Metis SDK, LazAI, and more. All of this, of ReGenesis is encapsulated in the Metis brand and value captured through a single token, creating a unified front in how Metis takes on the incumbent and new industries in the blockchain space.\u00c2\u00a0\"The multi-network architecture represents our understanding that no single chain design can optimally serve all Web3 applications,\" explains the Metis technical team. \"Specializing each network while ensuring seamless interoperability supports an ecosystem where developers can deploy different components of their applications to the chain that best suits each specific function.\"Andromeda: The Established FoundationMetis Andromeda was the first step in Metis' commitment to building scalable decentralized infrastructure, becoming our cornerstone network, offering reliable support for general-purpose decentralized applications. Using an optimistic rollup design, Andromeda delivers the security guarantees of Ethereum while significantly improving transaction throughput and reducing costs.The network has demonstrated particular strength in supporting DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and various applications where deterministic execution and proven track record are paramount. Its established decentralized sequencer network and battle-tested infrastructure make it the ideal foundation for applications where reliability takes precedence over extreme performance requirements.Andromeda's optimistic rollup implementation follows the time-tested approach of assuming transactions are valid until proven otherwise. This requires a fraud-proof window that maximizes security while still delivering substantial performance improvements over Ethereum's base layer. Current ecosystem participants include a diverse range of protocols and applications that benefit from this balanced approach.As Hyperion enters the ecosystem, Andromeda will continue its evolution, with ongoing optimizations to its core infrastructure, such as onchain data availability and a fraud proof system. However, its fundamental role remains unchanged: providing rock-solid infrastructure for general-purpose applications where established security models and deterministic execution matter most.Andromeda has full DSEQ nodes already, making it the clear choice for projects that prioritize security and decentralization. It continues to serve traditional DeFi use cases, and this positioning will remain unchanged.To top it all off, Andromeda will reach Stage 0 in the near future, with Stage 1 being the target by the end of the year.Hyperion (HYPE): Reimagining Layer 2 for the AI EraWhile Andromeda excels at general-purpose applications, Hyperion (HYPE) represents a specialized leap forward in blockchain architecture. Built on the Metis SDK, Hyperion's core is the high-performance MetisVM, which combines Ethereum compatibility with infrastructure explicitly designed for AI applications.Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions that merely iterate on existing designs, Hyperion addresses fundamental limitations that have constrained blockchain performance and creates barriers to adoption.MetisVM's technical breakthroughs are driving the next wave of innovation in blockchain and decentralized AI applications, featuring:Exceptional performance through advanced opcode processing and custom instruction extensions.Speculative and parallel execution powered by predictive algorithms for contract operations.State-aware caching to intelligently store frequently accessed smart contract state variables.Optimized inference engines, hardware acceleration, and zero-knowledge proofs for efficient and secure AI model operations within blockchain infrastructure.Hyperion is especially designed for high-performance computing applications that can benefit from AI, such as high-frequency trading, gaming, and DePIN, making it non-competitive with Andromeda.\"Aside from being a faster Layer 2, Hyperion is a fundamentally different approach to blockchain execution designed from first principles to support AI-native computation,\" notes Metis Executive Lead Tom Ngo. \"Applications that would be prohibitively expensive or simply impossible on traditional chains become viable through Hyperion's specialized architecture.\"Technical Innovations: How Hyperion Achieves Breakthrough PerformanceIn addition to MetisVM, Hyperion's performance advantages arise from three core technical innovations that work together to redefine Layer 2 capabilities.Optimistic Rollup with Parallel ExecutionTraditional blockchain execution processes transactions sequentially, creating an inherent bottleneck. Hyperion shatters this limitation through:Instant Transaction Finality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Achieves near sub-second settlement through Optimistic Commitments.Parallel Execution Engine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Smart contracts and transactions run concurrently, significantly increasing processing speed.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ensures Ethereum-grade security while reducing costs and delays.The combined effect transforms execution efficiency. Consider a DeFi application processing multiple swaps: where traditional chains would handle these sequentially, Hyperion executes them in parallel when they affect different liquidity pools. For AI applications performing multiple inference operations, the performance improvements scale even more dramatically.This approach maintains the performance benefits of sequenced transactions while eliminating the centralization risks that have plagued other high-performance networks.MetisDB: Next-Gen State Management SystemBlockchain performance relies on efficient state management, and Hyperion leverages MetisDB to enable instant state access, optimized transaction processing, and cost-effective data management.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0MetisDB achieves this through:Memory-Mapped Merkle Trees: Delivering near nanosecond-level state access for real-time applications.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Enabling parallel state updates for high-speed execution.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Asynchronous I/O Processing: Ensuring low-latency, high-throughput storage operations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0This innovative approach removes storage bottlenecks, enabling seamless execution of high-frequency blockchain transactions.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain InteroperabilityWhile pushing the boundaries of performance, Hyperion remains fully secured by Ethereum's settlement layer. State commitments are posted to Ethereum, ensuring that the network inherits the same security guarantees as the base layer.Hyperion is interoperable with multiple blockchain ecosystems, ensuring seamless cross-chain liquidity and data flow, it enables:\u00e2\u0080\u008dShared Bridge & Cross-Chain Connectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Enables multi-chain liquidity and interoperability.Decentralized Data & Compute Aggregation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Connects AI-driven applications, compute providers, and data networks.With this approach, Hyperion builds a seamless Web3 infrastructure, enabling scalable decentralized applications to interact across blockchain networks with security guaranteed by Ethereum.The Power of Metis SDK: Enabling the Dual-Network EcosystemAt the foundation of Hyperion (as well as LazAI) is the Metis SDK, a comprehensive development toolkit that enables seamless cross-chain interaction with high performance features and supports Hyperion's role as a liquidity hub in the broader blockchain ecosystem.The Metis SDK provides native tools for AI and high-performance dApps, making it significantly easier for developers to build AI-native applications without needing to manage complex blockchain interactions. This framework enables teams to create Metis-powered execution layers while overcoming underlying infrastructure challenges.SDK-driven standardization ensures compatibility between Andromeda and Hyperion, reinforcing the dual-chain architecture and enabling applications to easily span both networks when needed. This interoperability is crucial for the ecosystem's cohesive functioning.By leveraging the Metis SDK, developers can unlock new possibilities that elevate the entire blockchain ecosystem, creating applications that combine the security of established blockchain infrastructure with cutting-edge performance capabilities.Complementary Networks: Greater Than the Sum of Their PartsThe true innovation in Metis' approach lies not just in the individual networks but in how they complement each other. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, Andromeda and Hyperion are designed to work together seamlessly:Specialized Execution Environments: Developers can deploy core smart contracts on Andromeda for composability with the current ecosystem while routing computation-intensive protocols to Hyperion.Seamless Asset Movement: Assets can flow freely between networks through shared bridge infrastructure, creating a unified liquidity environment.Consistent Developer Experience: Similar tools and interfaces work across both networks, minimizing the learning curve for teams building on Metis.Additionally, asset interoperability will be maintained between both chains, forming a key part of the Dual-Chain Collaboration mechanism.\"The dual-network strategy creates natural expansion paths for projects as they evolve,\" explains Metis Executive Lead Tom Ngo again. \"Applications can start with standard functionality on Andromeda and gradually incorporate AI components through Hyperion as their needs grow, all while maintaining a unified user experience.\"Developer Experience and Use Case SuitabilityThe complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion creates a natural affinity for different application components:Andromeda is ideal for:Core financial contracts where proven reliability and composability is paramountLong-term data storage requiring maximum decentralizationTraditional DeFi applications with established execution patternsEnterprise applications requiring deterministic execution guaranteesHyperion excels at:AI-native applications requiring computational efficiencyHigh-frequency trading and complex DeFi operationsOnchain gaming with real-time interaction requirementsApplications with dynamic computational needsFor developers, the decision isn't binary\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's about strategic deployment across both networks based on component requirements. The Metis SDK abstracts much of the complexity, allowing teams to focus on application logic rather than network-specific implementations.Migration paths exist for integrating AI capabilities into existing Andromeda applications. Initial deployment on Andromeda provides stability and composability with established protocols while experimental features can be tested on Hyperion, creating a natural evolution path that minimizes risk while maximizing innovation potential.METIS Token: Unified Economic LayerThe METIS token sits at the center of this ecosystem architecture, meaning Hyperion is expanding Metis' capabilities rather than replacing Andromeda. METIS will capture value and maintain utility across both networks through multiple mechanisms:Native Gas Token: METIS serves as the native gas token for all transactions across both Andromeda and Hyperion, creating consistent demand regardless of which network users choose.Unified Value Capture: Transaction volume from AI-intensive applications on Hyperion and general DApps on Andromeda both contribute to token value in a unified economic system.Cross-Network Utility: Staking, governance, and other token functions work seamlessly across both networks, eliminating fragmentation of the token economy.This multi-chain approach ensures that as the ecosystem expands, METIS token utility strengthens proportionally across all network activities. New application categories enabled by Hyperion's specialized architecture create additional utility for the token, benefiting the entire ecosystem.\u00c2\u00a0It's important to note that Metis was initially issued on Ethereum, and the Metis token on Andromeda is not its native issuance\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is also the case for Hyperion.Long-term Ecosystem Growth StrategyOur dual-network strategy represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable ecosystem growth. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, the complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion creates natural expansion paths.\u00c2\u00a0This approach also insulates the ecosystem from market cycles by diversifying use cases across different technological domains. As general DeFi applications provide reliable baseline activity, AI applications drive innovation and new growth frontiers. The balanced, dual-network foundation aims to create long-term resilience while still enabling cutting-edge development.The strategy positions Metis uniquely in the Layer 2 landscape. Instead of fragmenting into competing chains or stretching single-network designs beyond their optimal use cases, Metis creates specialized environments that work together seamlessly. This approach aligns with enterprise requirements where different workloads routinely run on specialized infrastructure optimized for specific tasks.Implementation Timeline and Integration RoadmapHyperion's development and integration into the Metis ecosystem follows a structured timeline designed to ensure stability while introducing its enhanced capabilities:April - May 2025: Testnet LaunchMay - August 2025: Mainnet LaunchSeptember - December 2025: Mainnet UpgradesThroughout this rollout, Metis will provide comprehensive support for developers transitioning between networks, including documentation, grants for teams building cross-network applications, and technical assistance for optimization.Future Vision: Beyond the Dual-Network ModelWhile the dual-network architecture represents a significant advancement in Layer 2 design, our vision extends further into the future of blockchain infrastructure. The modular approach established by Andromeda and Hyperion creates a foundation for further specialization as new application categories emerge.Just as Hyperion was purpose-built for AI-native applications, future specialized execution environments could target other emerging workloads with unique requirements. This modular architecture positions Metis to rapidly adapt to shifting technological landscapes while maintaining the security and developer experience that form the core of its value proposition.The integration between Hyperion and LazAI, Metis' previously announced AI infrastructure, creates particularly interesting possibilities. As onchain AI applications mature, the synergy between these technologies will enable entirely new categories of decentralized applications that leverage both blockchain security and AI capabilities.Conclusion: Redefining the Layer 2 LandscapeThe introduction of Hyperion alongside Andromeda signals a fundamental rethinking of how Layer 2 solutions should evolve. By recognizing that different applications require different optimization priorities, we are creating an ecosystem architecture that delivers the best of both worlds: the proven security and stability of established Layer 2 technology alongside the cutting-edge performance needed for next-generation applications.This dual-network strategy positions Metis uniquely in the Layer 2 landscape. While other solutions force tradeoffs between security, performance, and decentralization, Metis allows developers to optimize each component of their application for its specific requirements. The result is an ecosystem that can simultaneously support traditional DeFi applications, enterprise workloads, and AI-native innovations without compromise.As blockchain technology continues its march toward mainstream adoption, the flexibility and scalability of our approach creates a foundation for sustainable growth. Solving the core challenges that have limited Layer 2 adoption\u00e2\u0080\u0094centralized sequencers, network congestion, and rigid economic models\u00e2\u0080\u0094allows us to build infrastructure capable of supporting the next wave of blockchain innovation.Rather than the future of Layer 2 being restricted to a single chain design optimized for all use cases, the dual-network approach is fostering a modular ecosystem where specialized networks work together seamlessly to enable applications that were previously impossible. With Andromeda and Hyperion, Metis is bringing that future into reality.Related PostTechnologyMETIS Incentives Live on SynapseTechnologyToken economics #1: Why do we need token economics, still?Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

This is a significant step in our commitment to greater transparency and community engagement. We're also proud to introduce Daniel Kwak, who serves as both the Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Metis and the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of LazAI. This dynamic leadership team is part of our enhanced strategy to connect more deeply with our community and partners as we enter this transformative phase.The Dawn of a New Blockchain EraOur recent AMA session featuring Tom, Natalia, and Daniel delivered compelling insights into Metis Hyperion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a breakthrough development poised to redefine how blockchain and AI converge. The team shared their vision for a technology that doesn't just improve upon existing solutions but fundamentally expands what's possible.Tom described Hyperion in terms that captured its groundbreaking potential: \"a high-performance AI-targeted infrastructure\" built specifically for tomorrow's demands. His analogy resonated strongly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 traditional blockchain technology is comparable to a 3G wireless network, while Hyperion represents \"5G LTE and moving on to 6G.\" This isn't just an incremental improvement; it's a significant leap forward that addresses the fundamental limitations that have held blockchain adoption back in critical sectors.Reimagining AI for a Decentralized WorldNatalia shared our bold \"ReGenesis\" vision, which she powerfully described as \"a rebirth of Metis in the era of AI.\" She highlighted a pressing challenge in today's tech landscape: AI is developing within a \"centralized bubble\" where a handful of tech giants control our data, models, and algorithms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a situation that demands disruption.This is where blockchain technology becomes a game-changer. Our team envisions blockchain and AI as \"complementary and synergetic technologies,\" with blockchain having \"great potential to elevate AI, bring it to the next level, and help with addressing some of the key issues such as trust, verifiability, equal access.\" This is more than just improving technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's about democratizing the future of AI.Daniel cut through the noise to explain why Hyperion matters now: \"What we found was a gap in the industry where we saw that the needs of AI weren't really truly being met by any of the incumbents.\" Rather than chasing trends, Hyperion is filling a critical market need that no one else has properly addressed.Two Powerful Networks, One Unified EcosystemMany community members have asked how Hyperion will work alongside our established Andromeda network. Let's be clear: these networks are designed to complement each other, not replace one another. Tom explained this relationship thoroughly, noting that the two networks will operate in parallel, with Andromeda providing widespread access (like 3G) while Hyperion delivers specialized high-speed capabilities (like 5G/LTE) for specific high-performance applications.\"The two networks will work in parallel,\" Tom emphasized, with both powered by the METIS token. This is crucial to understand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion will use METIS as its gas token, and there are no plans to launch a separate Hyperion token. This creates a cohesive, unified ecosystem despite the different technical capabilities of each network.Daniel elaborated that Andromeda will continue as the trusted \"general purpose all use case Web3 network\" with its proven track record of decentralized sequencing (dSeq) and progression toward Stage 1, while Hyperion will serve \"almost like a halo\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 attracting attention and innovation with its high-performance capabilities specifically optimized for AI applications. Each network serves distinct needs within our growing ecosystem, creating synergies that strengthen the entire Metis ecosystem.Performance That Shatters ExpectationsHyperion's technical specifications aim to be industry-defining. With 1-2 gigagas per second processing power, Hyperion represents a giant leap in blockchain capabilities. Natalia explained what this means in tangible terms: \"unprecedented scalability, ultra-low latency, and also of course very high throughput\" creating advantages for both developers and users that simply weren't possible before.For everyday blockchain users, this delivers an \"almost Web2-like speed experience, which removes the lag and congestion and of course the high fees from blockchain interactions.\" For developers, it eliminates the constraints that have limited innovation, opening doors to applications that were previously unthinkable on blockchain.MetisVM: The Powerhouse Driving AI IntegrationAt the heart of Hyperion lies the groundbreaking MetisVM (Metis Virtual Machine), which Natalia described as \"a high-performance virtual machine developed to enhance the integration of artificial intelligence within a decentralized framework.\"While maintaining seamless compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), MetisVM introduces several advanced features specifically engineered for AI applications:Strategic separation of computing and storage functions for optimized performancePowerful support for parallel execution enabling unprecedented throughputHighly efficient dynamic code optimization reducing computational costsInnovative state-aware caching for faster data access and processingThese capabilities bridge the gap between blockchain and AI while creating \"an open and scalable decentralized infrastructure\" ensuring AI development remains \"transparent, verifiable, and aligned with human goals\" rather than controlled by centralized entities.Parallel Execution: The Key to Unlocking AI PotentialDaniel explained how Hyperion's parallel execution fundamentally transforms transaction processing, describing it as \"having multiple queues of transactions executing at the same time with mutual exclusion, while ensuring consistency between the results of serial and parallel execution.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis capability is absolutely critical for data-intensive AI applications, particularly model training that demands processing vast amounts of information simultaneously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a requirement that traditional blockchain architectures simply cannot meet.Real-World Applications That Will Transform IndustriesThe team highlighted several immediate applications that stand to be transformed by Hyperion's capabilities:Next-Generation DeFi and TradingTom emphasized how Hyperion will transform trading by solving the critical limitations in speed and throughput that have kept traditional finance from fully embracing blockchain. \"In traditional finance, trading timing is everything because the market moves fast,\" he noted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a challenge that Hyperion is uniquely positioned to address, potentially unlocking billions in traditional finance value.Unleashing High-Frequency Trading on BlockchainDaniel explained that high-frequency trading \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a multi-billion dollar industry in traditional finance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has been essentially impossible on blockchain due to network limitations. Hyperion changes this equation completely, potentially bringing this massive market segment into the blockchain ecosystem.AI Training and Inference at ScaleBy supporting onchain AI inference and machine learning models with unprecedented performance, Hyperion enables developers to create sophisticated AI applications with blockchain's security and transparency advantages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 applications that could fundamentally change how AI is developed, verified, and trusted.The Exciting Road AheadOur ReGenesis roadmap is accelerating quickly. Daniel shared that Hyperion's testnet is expected between late April and mid-May 2025, with the mainnet following around August. We're developing comprehensive campaigns for both users and developers to drive early adoption and showcase Hyperion's transformative capabilities.A key element of our strategy involves LazAI, which we're closely incubating. LazAI tackles the critical \"data alignment problem\" in AI, ensuring training data properly aligns with intended model outcomes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a perfect complement to Hyperion's infrastructure advantages.Daniel confidently articulated our vision: \"Regardless of how big we are and how big our competitors are, it's pretty much going to be irrefutable that Hyperion will be one of the top homes for AI,\" displaying the ambition behind this initiative and a clear-eyed assessment of the unique value Hyperion brings to the market.Be Part of the FutureMetis Hyperion represents an ambitious effort to create specialized blockchain infrastructure optimized for AI applications. By addressing the unique requirements of AI workloads through high-performance architecture, parallel execution, and optimized data handling, our roadmap aims to position Hyperion as the backbone of decentralized AI development.As Natalia concluded: \"Our vision is really to make Hyperion become the backbone of decentralized AI. But this is our vision, our approach. But it's up to you, our community, our supporters, and our developers to jump on that and really build it out and show what the new world with decentralized AI can look like.\"The future of blockchain-AI integration is taking shape now \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we invite you to be at the forefront of this exciting new frontier.Related PostTechnologyThe Buzz About BEES: Meme Token with a MissionEcosystemMetis Launches its DAOtribution Grants Campaign on KORIS!Follow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

Traditional Layer 2 solutions, though an improvement over Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base layer, still struggle with congestion, centralized sequencers, and limited adaptability for AI-driven workloads.Hyperion (HYPE) is built to break through these limitations. Designed specifically for AI developers, DeFi protocols, and gaming applications, Hyperion is an ultra-fast, AI-optimized Layer 2 blockchain that eliminates the compromises of traditional rollup solutions. It introduces a high-performance modular rollup architecture, providing real-time execution, parallel processing, decentralized sequencing, and seamless Ethereum interoperability. With Hyperion, developers gain access to scalability without trade-offs, ensuring that complex applications perform at Web2-like speeds without sacrificing decentralization or security.Hyperion achieves 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions that will be available for AI engineers building in Web3.Hyperion vs. Andromeda: A Dual-Chain EcosystemHyperion is not replacing Andromeda, the existing Metis Layer 2 network, but rather expanding Metis' ecosystem with a specialized, high-performance infrastructure. While Andromeda serves as the general-purpose Layer 2 platform for Ethereum dApps, Hyperion introduces a more advanced modular rollup architecture tailored for high-frequency, AI-powered applications. This dual-chain strategy ensures that Metis can support the full spectrum of Web3 applications, offering tailored infrastructure solutions without compromise.Why Hyperion MattersLet's delve into why Hyperion is critical for the future of AI + Web3 applications and how its innovations solve fundamental issues that have long plagued Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.MetisVM: The AI-Optimized Virtual MachineAI applications require substantial computational power, and standard Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) are not designed to handle the high-performance execution demands of AI models. Hyperion introduces MetisVM, a custom-built virtual machine optimized for on-chain AI inference and high-throughput dApps.How MetisVM accelerates smart contract execution:Dynamic Opcode Optimization: Smart contract execution is enhanced with dynamically optimized opcodes, reducing gas fees and improving efficiency.Speculative & Parallel Execution: AI-powered dApps can predict, precompute, and execute certain actions in parallel, greatly increasing processing speed.State-Aware Caching: Instead of fetching redundant data repeatedly, MetisVM caches frequently accessed information, ensuring faster execution times for AI and high-performance applications.Why it matters: AI developers can now run machine learning models, inference engines, and data-driven smart contracts natively on-chain, something that was previously impossible without off-chain solutions.Instant, Parallelized Transaction Processing: Hyper-ScalabilityTraditional Layer 2 solutions operate using a sequential transaction execution model, creating performance bottlenecks under high demand. Hyperion introduces a Parallel Execution Engine with an Optimistic Rollup model that enables real-time, concurrent transaction processing, a necessity for AI driven, gaming, and high-frequency DeFAI applications.\u00c2\u00a0How Hyperion achieves real-time execution:Optimistic Model: Transactions are initially assumed valid and settled quickly, with fraud-proof mechanisms ensuring network integrity.Parallel Execution Engine: Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, Hyperion allows multiple transactions and smart contracts to execute at the same time, significantly reducing delays and increasing scalability.Optimized Fraud-Proof Mechanisms: Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions where fraud proofs can slow down execution, Hyperion optimizes fraud-checking processes, making the network both fast and secure.Why it matters: High-performance applications like on-chain AI, decentralized gaming, and real-time trading require sub-second execution times. Hyperion removes performance bottlenecks that have previously hindered Web3 innovation.MetisDB: Breaking the Blockchain Storage BottleneckBlockchain state management is a significant bottleneck for high-performance applications. MetisDB introduces an advanced storage system, enabling instant state access and cost-efficient data management.How MetisDB optimizes storage:Memory-Mapped Merkle Trees: Transactions are verified with near nanosecond-level state access, eliminating delays caused by slow storage retrieval.Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Allows simultaneous updates to blockchain state, avoiding bottlenecks in state modifications.Asynchronous I/O Processing: Storage read/write operations are optimized in real time, ensuring transactions complete faster without unnecessary computation delays.Why it matters: AI applications demand high-speed data retrieval and storage efficiency. MetisDB ensures that Web3 AI applications can scale without being slowed down by traditional blockchain state management issues.Ethereum Settlement & Seamless Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion is not an isolated blockchain, it is designed to be deeply integrated with Ethereum and the broader Web3 ecosystem. By leveraging periodic state commitments and cross-chain connectivity, Hyperion ensures that developers can build dApps that interact seamlessly across multiple networks ensuring that assets, liquidity, and data can flow freely across EVM chains.How Hyperion ensures cross-chain functionality:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: Hyperion periodically commits state changes to Ethereum, ensuring Ethereum-level security while maintaining cost efficiency. This means that all transactions on Hyperion ultimately derive security from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle-tested consensus model, providing finality and immutability without excessive fees.Shared Bridge & Multi-Chain Liquidity: Hyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared bridge framework facilitates the movement of assets and liquidity across multiple EVM compatible chains. This enables developers to create cross-chain AI models, gaming economies, and DeFi applications.\u00c2\u00a0Decentralized Data & Compute Aggregation: Hyperion integrates with off-chain compute networks, allowing AI applications to access external processing power while still maintaining the integrity of on-chain execution. AI developers can deploy high-compute inference models on-chain, leveraging distributed compute providers for enhanced scalability.Why it matters: AI and gaming developers need real-time, low-cost, and high-security environments to operate effectively. Hyperion ensures that developers can settle assets securely on Ethereum, move liquidity across multiple chains, and tap into decentralized compute power, creating truly scalable Web3 applications.Resistant, Reliable, and Fair Execution: Decentralized SequencingOne of the most persistent flaws in existing Layer 2 rollups is their reliance on centralized sequencers, which introduce risks of censorship, unfair transaction ordering, and single points of failure. Hyperion eliminates these vulnerabilities by implementing a Decentralized Sequencer Network that ensures resistance, reliability, and fairness in transaction processing.How Hyperion ensures fair execution:Leader Rotation Mechanism: Instead of relying on a single entity, Hyperion rotates sequencers dynamically, ensuring that no one party controls the network or influences transaction ordering.Timeout Failover: If a sequencer node goes offline or fails to validate transactions within a specified timeframe, another sequencer immediately takes over. This eliminates downtime and ensures uninterrupted transaction flow.MEV-Resistant Ordering: By leveraging encrypted mempools and Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), Hyperion eliminates front-running and ensures transactions are processed in the fairest possible order.Why it matters: Centralized sequencers in existing Layer 2s introduce trust assumptions that go against blockchain core principles. Hyperion ensures transactions remain censorship-resistant, unbiased, and free from manipulation, making it an ideal foundation for AI-driven automation and high-frequency financial applications. Users and developers no longer have to worry about network manipulation or censorship, making Hyperion a truly neutral execution layer.Conclusion: Hyperion - The Unstoppable Force of AI-Powered Blockchain InnovationHyperion is an evolutionary leap forward in Web3-powered AI future technology. It dismantles the traditional barriers of speed, efficiency, and decentralization, crafting an ecosystem where AI developers, DeFi innovators, and game creators can finally build without compromise. With its cutting-edge parallel execution, decentralized sequencing, and Ethereum-level security, Hyperion aims to power Web3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future with AI.Why Hyperion changes everything:\u00e2\u009c\u0085 1-2 gigagas per second, making it one of the highest-performing Layer 2 solutions available today.\u00e2\u009c\u0085 AI-Native & Gaming-Ready \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Built for AI inference, machine learning, and ultra-fast gaming.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u009c\u0085 Ethereum-Level Security + Cross-Chain Compatibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Fully composable with Ethereum and beyond.Hyperion will set the foundation of a new era in AI and blockchain synergy by providing the infrastructure for the most demanding applications of today and the next-gen innovations of tomorrow.

HYPE is a next-generation, high-performance Layer 2 network designed to optimize scalability, decentralization, and real-time transaction efficiency.\u00c2\u00a0Built on the Metis SDK, the core of Metis Hyperion (HYPE) is the high-performance virtual machine MetisVM, which is compatible with Ethereum and provides corresponding infrastructure support for AI applications. It offers unparalleled efficiency and performance for executing smart contracts such as DeFi, onchain gaming, and AI inference.\u00c2\u00a0MetisVM's multi-layered architecture ensures three critical elements: uncompromising security, seamless scalability, and enterprise-grade reliability. Optimizing for traditional smart contracts and AI-specific operations enables MetisVM to create the foundation that powers the Metis Hyperion ecosystem.Hyperion architecture introduces a high-throughput, low-latency architecture representing a fundamental advance in blockchain performance, enabling AI applications and complex DeFi operations that were previously impossible at scale.While Andromeda remains the foundation of Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ecosystem, Hyperion (HYPE) brings a modular and adaptable rollup architecture, catering to high-frequency DeFi, gaming, and AI-driven workloads. This marks a significant evolution for Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, delivering unprecedented speed, decentralization, and interoperability.Why Metis Hyperion?Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have improved scalability, but existing rollups still face critical limitations, including centralized sequencers, network congestion, and rigid gas payment models. Hyperion directly addresses these challenges by introducing:Optimistic Rollup & Parallel Execution: Real-time transaction processing and near-instant finality.Decentralized Sequencer Network: A fair, scalable, and censorship-resistant system that optimizes AI workloads.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain Interoperability: Ensuring seamless liquidity movement and compatibility with Ethereum and other blockchains.Hyperion's specialized infrastructure enables AI applications to achieve performance previously impossible on blockchain networks.Hyperion is pioneering new possibilities for a Layer 2\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is designed to be the first AI-optimized rollup, enabling AI-native computation, decentralized sequencing, and seamless cross-chain asset movement.Key TechnologyOptimistic Rollup & Parallel ExecutionHyperion integrates parallelized transaction execution with an Optimistic Rollup model, significantly increasing transaction throughput and reducing latency. The execution model employs:Block-STM-based Parallel Execution: Processes multiple transactions simultaneously, eliminating traditional bottlenecks.Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC): Reduces rollback overhead, optimizing execution efficiency.Dynamic DAG Scheduling: Ensures optimal transaction sequencing for AI and high-frequency applications.Hyperion's parallel execution architecture fundamentally transforms the economics of complex smart contract operations, particularly for data-intensive applications. By processing multiple transactions simultaneously through Block-STM and optimistic concurrency control, computing resources are utilized with unprecedented efficiency. This translates directly to lower gas costs for users. Protocols with complex calculations benefit from similar efficiencies.\u00c2\u00a0The system's dynamic DAG scheduling further optimizes resource allocation by intelligently grouping non-conflicting transactions, ensuring maximum throughput while minimizing computational waste. For developers, this cost efficiency opens new possibilities for onchain applications that would be prohibitively expensive on other networks.\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bDecentralized Sequencer NetworkUnlike traditional rollups that rely on centralized sequencers, Hyperion (HYPE) will move to a fully decentralized sequencer model, distributing sequencing responsibilities dynamically to prevent MEV attacks, censorship, and single points of failure.Leader Rotation Mechanism: Ensures fair, distributed sequencing to prevent monopolization.MEV-Resistant Ordering: Encrypted mempools & Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) eliminate front-running and unfair advantages.AI Optimization: Dynamically allocates sequencer resources for AI-powered applications.Ethereum Settlement & Cross-Chain InteroperabilityHyperion remains fully secured by Ethereum while offering multi-chain connectivity:Optimized Ethereum Settlement: State commitments to Ethereum for long-term security.Shared Bridge & Cross-Chain Compatibility: Seamlessly connects assets and liquidity across multiple chains.Native Paymaster Support (Coming Soon): Allows gas payments in ETH, USDC, and USDT, lowering entry barriers for mainstream adoption.Hyperion & Andromeda: A Multi-Network FutureMetis Hyperion (HYPE) and Andromeda will coexist within the Metis ecosystem, serving distinct yet complementary roles:Andromeda: Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first and most established Layer 2, optimized for general-purpose decentralized applications (DApps).Hyperion (HYPE): A high-performance, AI-native execution layer prioritizing speed, decentralized sequencing, and AI-driven workloads.This multi-network approach ensures that developers and enterprises have the flexibility to deploy applications tailored to their specific needs, benefiting from Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shared Layer 2 technology.METIS Token Multi-chain UtilityThe METIS token sits at the center of the ecosystem's economic model, capturing value and maintaining utility on both Andromeda and Hyperion networks through multiple mechanisms. As the native gas token for all transactions across both chains, METIS maintains consistent demand regardless of which network users choose.\u00c2\u00a0This dual-network utility creates a unified economic system where transaction volume from AI-intensive applications on Hyperion and general DApps on Andromeda both contribute to token value. This multi-chain approach ensures that as the ecosystem expands, METIS token utility strengthens proportionally across all network activities.Long-term Ecosystem Growth and Value ExpansionMetis' dual-network strategy represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable ecosystem growth. Rather than forcing all applications onto a one-size-fits-all solution, the complementary nature of Andromeda and Hyperion allows each to specialize while contributing to the whole. This creates natural expansion paths for projects as they evolve - starting with standard DApps on Andromeda and later incorporating AI components through Hyperion.The approach also insulates the ecosystem from market cycles by diversifying use cases across different technological domains. As general DeFi applications provide reliable baseline activity, AI applications drive innovation and new growth frontiers. A balanced, dual-network foundation creates long-term resilience while still enabling cutting-edge development.Hyperion RoadmapHyperion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rollout follows a structured development timeline:Feb - April 2025: Testnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 High-performance sequencer nodes go live.May - August 2025: Mainnet Launch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hyperion introduces its decentralized sequencer network and high-throughput Layer 2 framework.Sept - Dec 2025: Mainnet Upgrade \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Advanced execution optimizations, enabling instant feedback and parallel efficiency.ConclusionMetis Hyperion (HYPE) is redefining AI and Web3 integration, bringing Ethereum a high-performance, AI-optimized Layer 2 that enhances scalability, decentralization, and user experience.

The space has seen major shifts, from the early ICO boom to the rise of NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi. Each wave introduced new layers of utility, drawing attention and capital while laying the foundation for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next.\u00c2\u00a0Now, another powerful wave is forming: AI. Artificial Intelligence has transcended early expectations and hype cycles, proving its ability to drive real value across almost every domain including Web3. Similar to how DeFi experienced its hype cycle during DeFi Summer, but its core principles and applications have remained foundational. AI follows a similar trajectory: beyond speculation, it delivers real-world utility across industries, streamlining operations, improving decision-making, and unlocking new possibilities for automation.AI's impact isn't limited to a single use case. Whether it's predictive analytics, natural language processing, or decentralized autonomous agents, AI has an application in almost every sector. This broad applicability makes AI a compelling force in Web3, where efficiency, automation, and scalability are crucial.So why is Metis betting on AI? Because there is a clear gap in blockchain infrastructure that is capable of supporting AI-driven applications at scale. AI thrives on data, and blockchain offers a unique opportunity to provide transparent, verifiable, and decentralized data sources. By aligning blockchain with AI, Metis is creating an ecosystem where AI projects can operate more effectively and securely, while also benefiting from the decentralized principles that Web3 offers.Moreover, the timing couldn't be better. With the U.S. easing restrictions on AI and crypto, the regulatory landscape is becoming more favorable. This opens the door for rapid development and adoption. Web3 has been searching for its next big wave, and AI could be the catalyst to bring in mainstream adoption beyond just crypto-native users. Metis recognizes this opportunity and is positioning itself at the forefront of AI-powered blockchain innovation, ensuring AI has everything it needs to scale within Web3.But recognizing the opportunity is not enough. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive deeper into the \"why.\" Why is Metis taking this bold step?\u00c2\u00a0Our Strategy: Bridging the Gap in AI + CryptoThe intersection of AI and blockchain is still in its infancy, and while many blockchain projects acknowledge AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential, most are missing the mark entirely. Instead of addressing the real infrastructure challenges that AI developers face, they are throwing money at the problem, hoping hype will be enough to carry them forward. This kind of strategy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fall short, it creates systemic risk, leading to unsustainable bubbles similar to the 2000 dot-com crash or the speculative DeFi boom of 2021.Where Others Are Falling ShortGrants & Hackathons \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Many blockchain projects are resorting to grants and hackathons, believing that a burst of developer activity will lead to meaningful AI adoption. But this is just temporary engagement, without long-term infrastructure, these projects have nowhere to go after the funding runs dry. What happens when the incentives end? The builders leave, and the so-called AI revolution on these chains fizzles out.New AI-Focused Layer 1s \u00e2\u0086\u0092 The most dangerous trend in AI+Crypto is the sudden emergence of AI-focused Layer 1 blockchains. While this may seem like a bold innovation, it is an incredibly high-risk gamble. History has shown that launching a new Layer 1 is difficult, most fail to achieve critical mass, leading to abandoned ecosystems and wasted developer effort. If these AI-specific chains fail, every project built on them is at risk. The foundation crumbles, and the entire ecosystem collapses with it.Minor Token Upgrades \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Adjusting tokenomics to \u00e2\u0080\u009cincentivize AI\u00e2\u0080\u009d without addressing fundamental technical limitations is a band-aid, not a solution. Some networks slap AI-related buzzwords onto governance models, tweak a few incentive mechanisms, and claim they are AI-ready.The result? A chaotic landscape where projects are chasing hype rather than building sustainable AI ecosystems. If this trend continues, a handful of projects may survive, but without fundamental infrastructure, the majority will struggle to gain real adoption.AI developers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need more speculative schemes, they need robust, scalable infrastructure that allows them to deploy real applications. Very few blockchain projects are focusing on the actual computational demands of AI: high-speed processing, decentralized storage, and secure data verification.Metis understands these pitfalls and is taking a fundamentally different approach, one that goes beyond throwing money at the problem. Instead, Metis is focused on providing the infrastructure AI projects actually need to scale. This is where our two-pronged strategy comes into play.Our Commitment: A Two-Pronged ApproachMetis is not just another blockchain chasing the AI hype, we understand the real gaps in the industry, and we are building to address them. AI models are data-intensive, high-speed, and demand real-time computation. Traditional blockchains weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built for this level of execution. Developers need an environment where their AI applications can actually run without breaking.Our approach is grounded in delivering actual utility for AI builders by focusing on two critical areas:1. Providing Infrastructure AI Developers NeedBuilding AI-native applications is about giving developers the infrastructure they actually need to scale AI on-chain. AI projects require a high-performance execution layer, reliably high throughput, and a seamless developer experience. Without these, AI simply cannot function effectively on blockchain. This is exactly what Metis provides.\u00c2\u00a0High Throughput & Low Latency: AI workloads aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like standard Web3 applications. They require constant iteration, rapid processing, and fast decision-making. Whether it's AI-driven trading, autonomous agents executing contracts, or real-time DeFi optimizations, speed is everything. High transaction finality and low-latency execution are non-negotiable.A Stable, Reliable Network: AI-driven applications rely on consistency. Unlike human users, who can adapt to occasional congestion or high fees, AI models need a predictable and stable execution environment. If AI models experience unpredictable gas fees, downtime, or network congestion, their decision-making becomes flawed.\u00c2\u00a0Infrastructure Beyond Blockchain: AI applications require an ecosystem, not just a chain. For AI to be truly effective in Web3, developers need access to decentralized compute, storage, and indexing services. Without these services, AI developers struggle with fragmented data silos.2. Solving AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hardest Problems: Data MisalignmentOne of the most pressing issues in AI today is data misalignment, the inability of AI systems to align with human values and intentions due to flawed or incomplete training data. AI models rely on supervisory signals to learn, but these signals are often corrupted or missing, leading to outputs that fail to address real-world needs or ethical considerations. This results in AI-generated misinformation, bias, and hallucinations, issues that degrade trust and limit AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usability in high-stakes applications.Metis, through its incubation of LazAI, is directly addressing these issues. By leveraging blockchain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparency and verifiability, LazAI ensures that AI models can access structured, high-quality, and decentralized data sources. This not only mitigates data misalignment but also provides an open and collaborative ecosystem where AI applications can function with greater trust and reliability.Additionally, AI projects require interoperability and ease of integration with Web3 ecosystems. Metis has developed Alith, a blockchain-native AI agent framework through LazAI, enabling AI-powered applications to seamlessly function across multiple networks. This enhances their usability, adaptability, and real-world applicability, making it easier for AI models to integrate with decentralized finance, governance, and gaming platforms.The Future of AI & MetisThe fusion of AI and blockchain is only just beginning, and the possibilities ahead are vast. The same way DeFi transitioned from a speculative experiment into an essential component of every blockchain, AI will become a native intelligence layer that powers everything from on-chain automation to real-time decision-making and beyond.But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the key: AI needs a home built for it.For AI to fully integrate into Web3, it requires an environment that matches its computational needs, eliminates friction, and allows it to operate without barriers.\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what Metis is enabling.By building an ecosystem designed specifically to support AI, Metis is not just addressing the challenges of today, we are setting the foundation for the innovations of tomorrow. AI thrives when it has the right infrastructure to grow, and with Metis, AI developers are no longer constrained by network limitations, computational inefficiencies, or unreliable data sources.The future is not about forcing AI to adapt to blockchain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about giving AI the home it deserves, one where it can truly scale, explore, and redefine what is possible in the decentralized world. Metis is leading this charge, ensuring that AI isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another trend in Web3, but a fundamental force shaping the next era of innovation.Related PostCommunityIntroducing the Metis Business Development Bounty ProgramEcosystemMetis Expands Its Presence in South Korea with a Listing on BithumbFollow us onSubscribe to NewsletterThank you!

This initiative is designed to reward loyal community members, enhance user engagement, and solidify the Metis DeFi ecosystem's growth in collaboration with Artemis Finance.As a pivotal part of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer (DSEQ) Reboot program, this plan ensures that 4,000 oMETIS are allocated to Art-Points holders, recognizing their valuable contributions and ongoing support of the Artemis ecosystem.What Are Art-Points?Art-Points represent users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activity and contributions within the Artemis ecosystem. This innovative points system enables fair and transparent rewards based on engagement and participation. The longer users stay engaged, the higher the rewards they can earn.Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan: Timeline and RewardsTo begin earning Art-Points all you need to do is connect your wallet and deposit METIS directly on Artemis. Rewards will be distributed in three specific periods, with only newly earned points during each period being eligible for rewards. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works:Period 1: February 29, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 July 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward the rewards for Period 1.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not be eligible for Period 2 rewards.If you accumulated 100 points during this period, you will receive rewards based on your contribution to the total points pool.Period 2: July 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 October 4, 2024Reward Pool: 1,200 oMETISEligibility: Only points earned during this period will be eligible for rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before July 1, you will not accrue new points and therefore will not qualify for Period 2 rewards.If you retained some artMETIS and accumulated 50 points in this period, your rewards will be proportional to those 50 points.Period 3: October 5, 2024 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 January 24, 2025Reward Pool: 1,600 oMETISEligibility: Points earned during this period will count toward Period 3 rewards.Example:If you sold/redeemed all of your artMETIS before October 1, you will not qualify for rewards in this period.If you accrued 50 points during Period 3, you will receive rewards proportional to those 50 points.Please note that Art-Points are not tracked for short-term campaigns, such as the new Nitro Pool in Hercules or the Binance Web3 Wallet campaigns, which offer their own unique rewards. As a result, users participating in these campaigns are not eligible for oMETIS rewards.Why This Matters for Metis and Artemis EcosystemsThe Art-Points oMETIS Distribution Plan is a strategic effort to reward active participation and maintain strong user engagement within the Metis-Artemis ecosystem.

From the outset, we embraced innovation that dared to challenge conventions, setting us apart as an outlier among Layer 2 solutions. This spirit of ingenuity has driven us to take bold steps, face challenges head-on, and stay true to our mission: scaling Ethereum while championing decentralization and groundbreaking innovation.Over time, this commitment has solidified Metis as more than just a network\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movement. Our novel strategies stem from a deep respect for Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundational values and an unwavering desire to push the boundaries of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible. Alongside our community, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created a unique space for collaboration and inclusivity within the Ethereum ecosystem.As we move into 2025, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doubling down on our vision to demonstrate that being different doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean straying from Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethos - we intend to bolster Ethereum and its Layer 2 viability, and provide solutions through new technology. Through deliberate and thoughtful upgrades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bridging innovation with tradition, showcasing how a Layer 2 chain can balance forward-thinking technology with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core principles. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fortifying our infrastructure to ensure Metis becomes the most attractive and reliable destination for projects and users.This year is about blending the best of Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cypherpunk origins with the fearless creativity that defines Metis. Together, we will continue to break new ground, strengthening our position as a key contributor to Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. With collaboration,creativity , and a shared sense of purpose, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a network that embodies the very essence of innovation, community, and authenticity. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scale new heights, together.1. Quick Recap of Metis ArchitectureMetis is an L2 with optimistic architecture on Ethereum, offering:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fast and cheap L2 transactions\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Security anchored on Ethereum\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decentralized sequencers\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fraud proofs and DA enhancements in early 2025 (Q1)Fraud proofs prevent invalid state from persisting on L2, while data availability ensures enough transaction data is posted to Ethereum so watchers can reconstruct and validate L2 state transitions.With the sequencer layer decentralized, the next step (Q3) is to achieve full EVM equivalence and keep the L2 environment synced with the latest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) features and upgrades.2. Q1: Fraud Proofs & Data Availability (EIP-4844 Blobs)Fraud proofs are a cornerstone of ensuring the security and integrity of any Layer 2 blockchain. They empower network participants, commonly referred to as watchers, to challenge invalid L2 state roots or transactions. This mechanism ensures that even in the presence of malicious actors, the network remains resilient and trustworthy. The fraud proof process provides a transparent, on-chain method for resolving disputes, making it an essential feature of a decentralized Layer 2 ecosystem.Data Availability (DA) is vital for every Layer 2 blockchain, ensuring transaction and smart contract data remains secure, verifiable, and accessible. It underpins trust, transparency, and seamless interaction within the ecosystem.In April 2022, to reduce transaction costs, Metis transitioned its DA from Ethereum to Memo Labs, making us one of the most affordable L2 networks. This strategic move lowered barriers to adoption and enabled greater scalability.With Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Proto-Danksharding upgrade introducing cost-effective L1 blobs for temporary data storage, the DA landscape has evolved. This advancement allows Metis to align with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest innovations, enhancing affordability, decentralization, and performance.2.1 Fraud ProofsFraud proofs empower watchers to challenge any invalid L2 state root or transaction. The high-level flow:\u00c2\u00a01. Batch Proposal: A proposer (any sequencer node in the decentralized set) sends a batch of L2 transactions/state roots to Ethereum.\u00c2\u00a02. Challenge Window: A time window (e.g., 7 days) allows watchers to submit fraud proofs if they detect invalid state transitions.\u00c2\u00a03. \u00c2\u00a0Onchain Dispute: The fraud proof contract on L1 replays the disputed transaction(s) to check correctness.\u00c2\u00a04. Slashing & Reversion: If the state is found fraudulent, the batch is reverted, and the malicious proposer is slashed.Impact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Increases network security\u00e2\u0080\u0094invalid state cannot persist without being challenged.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Distributes trust\u00e2\u0080\u0094anyone can become a watcher and help secure the network.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Aligns Metis with other optimistic rollups that rely on L1-based dispute resolution.Below is a simplified example of a fraud-proof contract:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title FraudProofVerifier\n * @notice Illustrative contract to demonstrate a simplified fraud proof mechanism\n */\ncontract FraudProofVerifier {\n    // Batch index -> state root\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public batchStateRoots;\n\n    // Whether the batch is under dispute\n    mapping(uint256 => bool) public isUnderDispute;\n\n    event StateRootProposed(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot);\n    event FraudProofSubmitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, address indexed challenger);\n    event BatchInvalidated(uint256 indexed batchIndex);\n\n    function proposeStateRoot(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 stateRoot) external {\n        require(batchStateRoots[batchIndex] == 0, \"State root already set\");\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = stateRoot;\n        emit StateRootProposed(batchIndex, stateRoot);\n    }\n\n    function submitFraudProof(uint256 batchIndex, bytes calldata proofData) external {\n        require(!isUnderDispute[batchIndex], \"Batch already disputed\");\n\n        // Validate the proof data\u00e2\u0080\u0094replay or merkle-check the L2 transaction\n        bool isFraudulent = _verifyProof(proofData);\n\n        require(isFraudulent, \"No fraud detected\");\n        isUnderDispute[batchIndex] = true;\n        emit FraudProofSubmitted(batchIndex, msg.sender);\n\n        // Invalidate the batch if the proof is valid\n        _invalidateBatch(batchIndex);\n    }\n\n    function _verifyProof(bytes calldata proofData) internal pure returns (bool) {\n        // In a real implementation, you'd decode transactions, check state transitions, etc.\n        // Here, we return true for demonstration\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function _invalidateBatch(uint256 batchIndex) internal {\n        // For demonstration, revert the batch state root\n        batchStateRoots[batchIndex] = bytes32(0);\n        emit BatchInvalidated(batchIndex);\n    }\n}\n2.2 Data Availability with EIP-4844 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlobs\u00e2\u0080\u009dEIP-4844 introduces \u00e2\u0080\u009cblob\u00e2\u0080\u009d transactions that store data cheaply and temporarily on Ethereum. This approach reduces L2 fees because data posting to Ethereum mainnet becomes more cost-effective than older calldata methods.How Metis Uses Blobs\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Blob Commitments: The Metis sequencer (now decentralized) bundles L2 user transactions, compresses them, and posts them as blobs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Verification: The rollup contract on L1 holds a commitment (e.g., KZG polynomial commitment) to the blob data. Anyone can fetch the actual data from the blob to verify correctness if they need to submit a fraud proof.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Reduced Costs: Because blobs are cheaper to post and ephemeral, overall L2 gas costs drop for end users.A conceptual snippet that tracks blob commitments on-chain might look like this:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\n/**\n * @title DataAvailabilityRegistry\n * @notice Stores commitments (hashes or polynomial commitments) to EIP-4844 blobs\n */\ncontract DataAvailabilityRegistry {\n    // batch index -> blob commitment\n    mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public blobCommitments;\n\n    event BlobCommitted(uint256 indexed batchIndex, bytes32 commitment);\n\n    function storeBlobCommitment(uint256 batchIndex, bytes32 commitment) external {\n        // In practice: verify the caller is an authorized sequencer or aggregator\n        blobCommitments[batchIndex] = commitment;\n        emit BlobCommitted(batchIndex, commitment);\n    }\n\n    function validateBlobData(uint256 batchIndex, bytes memory rawData) public view returns (bool) {\n        // In real usage, you'd do a KZG polynomial check or a Merkle check\n        return keccak256(rawData) == blobCommitments[batchIndex];\n    }\n}\nImpact:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower Fees for L2 users, because posting data to L1 is the most expensive part of running an optimistic rollup.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Improved Transparency, as watchers can easily fetch the data from Ethereum for fraud proof purposes.3. Q3: Full EVM Equivalence & Staying Updated with the Latest EVM VersionThe current Metis EVM, as of the time of writing, operates at the Berlin (+PUSH0) version. However, it lags behind Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving EVM, which has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years. These upgrades include the London, Paris, Shanghai, Cancun, and the soon-to-be-released Pectra versions, each of which introduces critical improvements that enhance the Ethereum ecosystem.3.1 What Is EVM Equivalence?An EVM-equivalent rollup means the L2 runtime matches Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM specification exactly (or as close to 1:1 as possible) so that:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 All opcodes, gas metering, and execution semantics behave as they do on mainnet.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers can use the same tooling (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, Remix) without modification or custom compilers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Deploying a contract on Metis works the same way as deploying it on Ethereum, minimizing surprises.\u00c2\u00a0Note: Some older L2s are \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-compatible\u00e2\u0080\u009d but not fully \u00e2\u0080\u009cEVM-equivalent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which can cause subtle differences in gas usage, block gas limits, or opcode availability. Metis aims to eliminate these discrepancies in Q3 2025.3.2 Catching Up to the Latest EVM VersionEthereum undergoes frequent upgrades\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., Shanghai, Canc\u00c3\u00ban, or future hard forks that might introduce new opcodes or behaviors. Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q3 upgrade is designed to:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Integrate new EVM opcodes introduced on mainnet (e.g., PUSH0 from Shanghai).\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Match Gas Schedules so that on-chain execution cost is consistent with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost model.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Adopt Protocol Upgrades so that any features or bug fixes in the main Ethereum client are also reflected on Metis.A trivial example of using the PUSH0 opcode (introduced in Shanghai/Shanghai-like forks) in inline assembly is shown below (Solidity 0.8.20+). This opcode pushes a 0 value to the stack:\u00e2\u0080\u008d// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.20;\n\ncontract ExamplePush0 {\n    uint256 public someValue;\n\n    function usePush0() external {\n        assembly {\n            // push0 places 0 on the stack\n            push0\n            // sstore at slot 0 (someValue) with the top of the stack (which is 0)\n            sstore(someValue.slot, 0)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dOn older EVM implementations that lack PUSH0, this contract would fail to compile or revert at runtime. With Q3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM equivalence update, Metis ensures that the same contract runs identically to Ethereum mainnet.3.3 Benefits & Impact of Full EVM Equivalence\u00c2\u00a01. Developer Experience:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 No special compilers or config.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Off-the-shelf Ethereum libraries (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js) work seamlessly.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Faster onboarding of new devs or migrating existing mainnet projects to Metis.2. Tooling & Debugging:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat and Foundry can test and debug using the exact same environment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Less friction for advanced debugging or performance analysis.3. Easier Cross-Chain Bridges:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bridging logic can rely on consistent EVM state transitions and proofs.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fewer edge cases and less custom code to maintain for bridging solutions.4. Rapid Upgrades:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Because Metis stays in sync with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upgrades, new features introduced on Ethereum can quickly be adopted on L2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Future merges, forks, or EIPs won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause large divergences in the codebase.5. User Adoption:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Decreased confusion for end users about \u00e2\u0080\u009chow is L2 different from L1.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 More reliability, fewer failures when porting dApps over to L2.4. Putting It All Together\u00c2\u00a01. Decentralized Sequencers: Already implemented in Metis to reduce the single point of failure. Anyone meeting the requirements can join the set of sequencers and propose L2 blocks.\u00c2\u00a02. Fraud Proofs (Q1): Provide a robust challenge mechanism on L1, ensuring malicious or incorrect state transitions can be disputed and reverted.\u00c2\u00a03. Data Availability via Ethereum Blobs (Q1): Leveraging EIP-4844 for cheaper, ephemeral data posting, thereby lowering gas fees for L2 transactions and improving accessibility for watchers.\u00c2\u00a04. Full EVM Equivalence (Q3): Updating the entire Metis stack to match Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest EVM version, ensuring 1:1 opcode coverage, gas metering, and developer tooling compatibility.5. Practical Considerations & Migration\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Node Operators: Must upgrade their Metis nodes in Q3 to the new software version that supports the latest EVM changes.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Developers:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Existing contracts should \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but if you rely on newly introduced opcodes (e.g., PUSH0), you can only use them post-upgrade.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Tools like Hardhat or Truffle can be configured with the same compiler version used on mainnet, simplifying the pipeline.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Watchers: Should remain vigilant, especially during the Q3 transition, verifying that the upgraded L2 environment is producing valid state roots.6. ConclusionBy Q3 2025, Metis will have:\u00c2\u00a01. Deployed Fraud Proofs (Q1) and ensured robust dispute resolution on L1.\u00c2\u00a02. Adopted EIP-4844 Blobs (Q1) to lower data posting costs, thereby reducing user gas fees and boosting throughput.\u00c2\u00a03. Fully Aligned with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EVM (Q3), guaranteeing EVM equivalence so that developers can deploy, test, and maintain contracts as if they were on mainnet.These milestones reinforce Metis as a performant, decentralized, and user-friendly optimistic rollup. The Q3 focus on full EVM equivalence underscores Metis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to staying on the cutting edge of Ethereum development, ensuring a frictionless developer experience and the highest degree of compatibility with Ethereum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving ecosystem.\u00e2\u0080\u008dDisclaimer: The details, timelines, and implementation specifics are subject to change based on final Metis team announcements.
